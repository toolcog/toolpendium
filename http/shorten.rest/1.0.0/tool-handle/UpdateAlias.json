  "description": "Update a single short URL by providing its alias and domain as a parameter, and the data you wish to update in the body of the request. If no domain is provided you will receive the alias found attached to the Short.fyi domain (if it exists and is linked to your account!)\n\n ### NOTE: \n\n ( * )If you add a metatag or a snippet with a same name to an alias and the domain it's related to, the value will be taken from the alias and not the domain \n\n ( ** ) When you update any array property (like destinations) the block is updated **completely** so you have to specify the old records to avoid deleting them\n\n ( *** ) The method updates only the specified properties so if there was no change in one of them you don't have to send it.",
