It only notifies a specific marketplace (`accountName`) that a seller (`sellerId`) has changed the inventory level of an SKU (`skuId`). \n\n*Marketplaces* will then call the [fulfillment endpoint](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/fulfillment-simulation) provided in the seller registration form to get the updated inventory  information.",
