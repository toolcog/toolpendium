  "description": "You should use this endpoint to cancel an order by its `orderId`.\n\nA common scenario is one where the seller has a problem with the order fulfillment and needs to request the order cancellation to the marketplace. To do this, the seller would need to make this request, passing the `orderId` in the URL.\n\nYou should expect a response with the date when the notification was received, the orderId, and a receipt protocol code.\n\nBe aware that if the order status is already `Invoiced`, the order can only be canceled if - before using this request - you send a return invoice through the [Order Invoice Notification endpoint](https://developers.vtex.com/reference/invoice#invoicenotification).\n\r\n\r> The `Cancel order` resource is needed to use this API request. This is included in `OMS - Full access` and `IntegrationProfile - Fulfillment Oms`, among other default roles available in the Admin.
