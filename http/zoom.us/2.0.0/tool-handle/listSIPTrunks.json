  "description": "With SIP-connected audio, Zoom establishes a SIP trunk (a network connection specifically designed to make and deliver phone calls) over a direct and private connection between the customer’s network and the Zoom cloud. Meeting participants that dial into a meeting or have the meeting call them, and are On-Net from the perspective of the customers’ IP telephony network, will be connected over this trunk rather than over the PSTN.<br><br>\nUse this API to list all the SIP trunks assigned to a master account or a sub account of the master account. To retrieve SIP trunks assigned to a sub account, provide the account ID of the sub account in the `accountId` path parameter. To retrieve SIP trunks of a master account, provide `me` as the value of the `accountId` path parameter. <br><br> **Scope:** `sip_trunk:read:admin`\n<br><b>Prerequisites:</b><br>\n* The account must either be a master account or a sub account with [API Partner Plan](https://zoom.us/plan/api) and SIP Connected Audio Plan.",
