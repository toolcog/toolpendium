  "description": "With SIP-connected audio, Zoom establishes a SIP trunk (a network connection specifically designed to make and deliver phone calls) over a direct and private connection between the customerâ€™s network and the Zoom cloud. Meeting participants that dial into a meeting or have the meeting call them, and are On-Net from the perspective of the customers' IP telephony network, will be connected over this trunk rather than over the PSTN. <br><br> Using this API, a master account owner can copy the SIP Connected Audio configurations applied on the master account and enable those configurations on a sub account. The owner can also disable the configuration in the sub account where it was previously enabled. \n**Prerequisites:**<br>\n* Pro or a higher account with SIP Connected Audio plan enabled.\n* master account Owner<br>\n**Scopes:** `sip_trunk:master`<br> \n\n **[Rate Limit Label](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/rate-limits#rate-limits):** `Light`",
