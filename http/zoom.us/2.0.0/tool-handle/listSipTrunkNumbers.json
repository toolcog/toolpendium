  "description": "With SIP-connected audio, Zoom establishes a SIP trunk (a network connection specifically designed to make and deliver phone calls) over a direct and private connection between the customerâ€™s network and the Zoom cloud. Meeting participants that dial into a meeting or have the meeting call them, and are On-Net from the perspective of the customers' IP telephony network, will be connected over this trunk rather than over the PSTN. <br><br>Use this API to list all the numbers that are configured for SIP Connected Audio in a Zoom Account.\n\n**Prerequisites:**<br>\n* Pro or a higher account with SIP Connected Audio plan enabled.\n* The account must be a master account<br>\n**Scopes:** `sip_trunk:master`\n \n **[Rate Limit Label](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/rate-limits#rate-limits):** `Light`",
