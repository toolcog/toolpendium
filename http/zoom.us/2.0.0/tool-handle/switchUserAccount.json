  "description": "Disassociate a user from one Account and move the user to another Account under the same master account. \n\nWith this API, a user under a master account or a sub account can be moved to another sub account within the same master account. To move a user from a master account to a sub account, use `me` as the value for `accountId`. In this scenario, \"me\" refers to the Account ID of the master account. \n\nTo move a user from one sub account to another sub account, provide the sub account's Account ID as the value for `accountId`. \n\n**Prerequisites**:\n* The account should have Pro or a higher plan with master account option enabled.\n* The user whose account needs to be switched should not be an admin or an owner of that account.\n* The user should not have the same [managed domain](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/203395207-What-is-Managed-Domain-) as the account owner.\n\n**Scope:** `user:master`<br> \n\n **[Rate Limit Label](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/rate-limits#rate-limits):** `Light`",
