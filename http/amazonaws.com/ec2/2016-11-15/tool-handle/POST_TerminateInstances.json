  "description": "<p>Shuts down the specified instances. This operation is idempotent; if you terminate an instance more than once, each call succeeds. </p> <p>If you specify multiple instances and the request fails (for example, because of a single incorrect instance ID), none of the instances are terminated.</p> <p>If you terminate multiple instances across multiple Availability Zones, and one or more of the specified instances are enabled for termination protection, the request fails with the following results:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The specified instances that are in the same Availability Zone as the protected instance are not terminated.</p> </li> <li> <p>The specified instances that are in different Availability Zones, where no other specified instances are protected, are successfully terminated.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For example, say you have the following instances:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Instance A: <code>us-east-1a</code>; Not protected</p> </li> <li> <p>Instance B: <code>us-east-1a</code>; Not protected</p> </li> <li> <p>Instance C: <code>us-east-1b</code>; Protected</p> </li> <li> <p>Instance D: <code>us-east-1b</code>; not protected</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you attempt to terminate all of these instances in the same request, the request reports failure with the following results:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Instance A and Instance B are successfully terminated because none of the specified instances in <code>us-east-1a</code> are enabled for termination protection.</p> </li> <li> <p>Instance C and Instance D fail to terminate because at least one of the specified instances in <code>us-east-1b</code> (Instance C) is enabled for termination protection.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Terminated instances remain visible after termination (for approximately one hour).</p> <p>By default, Amazon EC2 deletes all EBS volumes that were attached when the instance launched. Volumes attached after instance launch continue running.</p> <p>You can stop, start, and terminate EBS-backed instances. You can only terminate instance store-backed instances. What happens to an instance differs if you stop it or terminate it. For example, when you stop an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, any attached EBS volumes with the <code>DeleteOnTermination</code> block device mapping parameter set to <code>true</code> are automatically deleted.
