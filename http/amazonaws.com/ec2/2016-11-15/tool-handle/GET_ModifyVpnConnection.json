  "description": "<p>Modifies the customer gateway or the target gateway of an Amazon Web Services Site-to-Site VPN connection. To modify the target gateway, the following migration options are available:</p> <ul> <li> <p>An existing virtual private gateway to a new virtual private gateway</p> </li> <li> <p>An existing virtual private gateway to a transit gateway</p> </li> <li> <p>An existing transit gateway to a new transit gateway</p> </li> <li> <p>An existing transit gateway to a virtual private gateway</p> </li> </ul> <p>Before you perform the migration to the new gateway, you must configure the new gateway. Use <a>CreateVpnGateway</a> to create a virtual private gateway, or <a>CreateTransitGateway</a> to create a transit gateway.</p> <p>This step is required when you migrate from a virtual private gateway with static routes to a transit gateway. </p> <p>You must delete the static routes before you migrate to the new gateway.</p> <p>Keep a copy of the static route before you delete it. You will need to add back these routes to the transit gateway after the VPN connection migration is complete.</p> <p>After you migrate to the new gateway, you might need to modify your VPC route table. Use <a>CreateRoute</a> and <a>DeleteRoute</a> to make the changes described in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/modify-vpn-target.html#step-update-routing\">Update VPC route tables</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Site-to-Site VPN User Guide</i>.</p> <p>When the new gateway is a transit gateway, modify the transit gateway route table to allow traffic between the VPC and the Amazon Web Services Site-to-Site VPN connection. Use <a>CreateTransitGatewayRoute</a> to add the routes.</p> <p> If you deleted VPN static routes, you must add the static routes to the transit gateway route table.</p> <p>After you perform this operation, the VPN endpoint's IP addresses on the Amazon Web Services side and the tunnel options remain intact. Your Amazon Web Services Site-to-Site VPN connection will be temporarily unavailable for a brief period while we provision the new endpoints.</p>",
