The options include:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>open</code> - The Capacity Reservation accepts all instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone). Instances that have matching attributes launch into the Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying any additional parameters.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>targeted</code> - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation.
