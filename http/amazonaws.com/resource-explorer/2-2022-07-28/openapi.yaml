  title: AWS Resource Explorer
  description: '<p>Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer is a resource search and discovery service. By using Resource Explorer, you can explore your resources using an internet search engine-like experience. Examples of resources include Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, or Amazon DynamoDB tables. You can search for your resources using resource metadata like names, tags, and IDs. Resource Explorer can search across all of the Amazon Web Services Regions in your account in which you turn the service on, to simplify your cross-Region workloads.</p> <p>Resource Explorer scans the resources in each of the Amazon Web Services Regions in your Amazon Web Services account in which you turn on Resource Explorer. Resource Explorer <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/getting-started-terms-and-concepts.html#term-index">creates and maintains an index</a> in each Region, with the details of that Region''s resources.</p> <p>You can <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region.html">search across all of the indexed Regions in your account</a> by designating one of your Amazon Web Services Regions to contain the aggregator index for the account. When you <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region-turn-on.html">promote a local index in a Region to become the aggregator index for the account</a>, Resource Explorer automatically replicates the index information from all local indexes in the other Regions to the aggregator index. Therefore, the Region with the aggregator index has a copy of all resource information for all Regions in the account where you turned on Resource Explorer. As a result, views in the aggregator index Region include resources from all of the indexed Regions in your account.</p> <p>For more information about Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer, including how to enable and configure the service, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/">Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide</a>.</p>'

You can create only one index in a Region.</p> <note> <p>This operation creates only a <i>local</i> index. To promote the local index in one Amazon Web Services Region into the aggregator index for the Amazon Web Services account, use the <a>UpdateIndexType</a> operation.

Use the wildcard character (<code>*</code>) at the end of the string to match the eventual UUID. For example, the following <code>Resource</code> element restricts the role or user to creating an index in only the <code>us-east-2</code> Region of the specified account.</p> <p> <code>"Resource": "arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-west-2:<i>&lt;account-id&gt;</i>:index/*"</code> </p> <p>Alternatively, you can use <code>"Resource": "*"</code> to allow the role or user to create an index in any Region.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Action</b>: <code>iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole</code> </p> <p> <b>Resource</b>: No specific resource (*). </p> <p>This permission is required only the first time you create an index to turn on Resource Explorer in the account.

Creating an index in an Amazon Web Services Region turns on Resource Explorer and lets it discover your resources.</p> <p>By default, an index is <i>local</i>, meaning that it contains information about resources in only the same Region as the index. However, you can promote the index of one Region in the account by calling <a>UpdateIndexType</a> to convert it into an aggregator index. The aggregator index receives a replicated copy of the index information from all other Regions where Resource Explorer is turned on.
