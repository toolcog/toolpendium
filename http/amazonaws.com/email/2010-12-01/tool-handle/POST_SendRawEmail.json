  "name": "POST_SendRawEmail",
  "description": "<p>Composes an email message and immediately queues it for sending.</p> <p>This operation is more flexible than the <code>SendEmail</code> API operation. When you use the <code>SendRawEmail</code> operation, you can specify the headers of the message as well as its content. This flexibility is useful, for example, when you want to send a multipart MIME email (such a message that contains both a text and an HTML version). You can also use this operation to send messages that include attachments.</p> <p>The <code>SendRawEmail</code> operation has the following requirements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You can only send email from <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-addresses-and-domains.html\">verified email addresses or domains</a>. If you try to send email from an address that isn't verified, the operation results in an \"Email address not verified\" error.</p> </li> <li> <p>If your account is still in the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html\">Amazon SES sandbox</a>, you can only send email to other verified addresses in your account, or to addresses that are associated with the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/mailbox-simulator.html\">Amazon SES mailbox simulator</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The maximum message size, including attachments, is 10 MB.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each message has to include at least one recipient address. A recipient address includes any address on the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you send a single message to more than one recipient address, and one of the recipient addresses isn't in a valid format (that is, it's not in the format <i>UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain</i>), Amazon SES rejects the entire message, even if the other addresses are valid.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each message can include up to 50 recipient addresses across the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines. If you need to send a single message to more than 50 recipients, you have to split the list of recipient addresses into groups of less than 50 recipients, and send separate messages to each group.</p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon SES allows you to specify 8-bit Content-Transfer-Encoding for MIME message parts. However, if Amazon SES has to modify the contents of your message (for example, if you use open and click tracking), 8-bit content isn't preserved. For this reason, we highly recommend that you encode all content that isn't 7-bit ASCII. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-email-raw.html#send-email-mime-encoding\">MIME Encoding</a> in the <i>Amazon SES Developer Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Additionally, keep the following considerations in mind when using the <code>SendRawEmail</code> operation:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Although you can customize the message headers when using the <code>SendRawEmail</code> operation, Amazon SES will automatically apply its own <code>Message-ID</code> and <code>Date</code> headers; if you passed these headers when creating the message, they will be overwritten by the values that Amazon SES provides.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are using sending authorization to send on behalf of another user, <code>SendRawEmail</code> enables you to specify the cross-account identity for the email's Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one of two ways: you can pass optional parameters <code>SourceArn</code>, <code>FromArn</code>, and/or <code>ReturnPathArn</code> to the API, or you can include the following X-headers in the header of your raw email:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>X-SES-SOURCE-ARN</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>X-SES-FROM-ARN</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN</code> </p> </li> </ul> <important> <p>Don't include these X-headers in the DKIM signature. Amazon SES removes these before it sends the email.</p> </important> <p>If you only specify the <code>SourceIdentityArn</code> parameter, Amazon SES sets the From and Return-Path addresses to the same identity that you specified.</p> <p>For more information about sending authorization, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html\">Using Sending Authorization with Amazon SES</a> in the <i>Amazon SES Developer Guide.</i> </p> </li> <li> <p>For every message that you send, the total number of recipients (including each recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted against the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period (your <i>sending quota</i>). For more information about sending quotas in Amazon SES, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/manage-sending-limits.html\">Managing Your Amazon SES Sending Limits</a> in the <i>Amazon SES Developer Guide.</i> </p> </li> </ul>",
