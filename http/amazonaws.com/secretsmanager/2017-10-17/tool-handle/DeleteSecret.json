  "description": "<p>Deletes a secret and all of its versions. You can specify a recovery window during which you can restore the secret. The minimum recovery window is 7 days. The default recovery window is 30 days. Secrets Manager attaches a <code>DeletionDate</code> stamp to the secret that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Secrets Manager deletes the secret permanently.</p> <p>You can't delete a primary secret that is replicated to other Regions. You must first delete the replicas using <a>RemoveRegionsFromReplication</a>, and then delete the primary secret. When you delete a replica, it is deleted immediately.</p> <p>You can't directly delete a version of a secret. Instead, you remove all staging labels from the version using <a>UpdateSecretVersionStage</a>. This marks the version as deprecated, and then Secrets Manager can automatically delete the version in the background.</p> <p>To determine whether an application still uses a secret, you can create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to alert you to any attempts to access a secret during the recovery window. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring_cloudwatch_deleted-secrets.html\"> Monitor secrets scheduled for deletion</a>.</p> <p>Secrets Manager performs the permanent secret deletion at the end of the waiting period as a background task with low priority. There is no guarantee of a specific time after the recovery window for the permanent delete to occur.</p> <p>At any time before recovery window ends, you can use <a>RestoreSecret</a> to remove the <code>DeletionDate</code> and cancel the deletion of the secret.</p> <p>When a secret is scheduled for deletion, you cannot retrieve the secret value. You must first cancel the deletion with <a>RestoreSecret</a> and then you can retrieve the secret.</p> <p>Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters because it might be logged.
