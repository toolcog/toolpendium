  "description": "<p>Creates an IAM entity to describe an identity provider (IdP) that supports <a href=\"http://openid.net/connect/\">OpenID Connect (OIDC)</a>.</p> <p>The OIDC provider that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in a role's trust policy. Such a policy establishes a trust relationship between Amazon Web Services and the OIDC provider.</p> <p>If you are using an OIDC identity provider from Google, Facebook, or Amazon Cognito, you don't need to create a separate IAM identity provider. These OIDC identity providers are already built-in to Amazon Web Services and are available for your use. Instead, you can move directly to creating new roles using your identity provider. To learn more, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html\">Creating a role for web identity or OpenID connect federation</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>When you create the IAM OIDC provider, you specify the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The URL of the OIDC identity provider (IdP) to trust</p> </li> <li> <p>A list of client IDs (also known as audiences) that identify the application or applications allowed to authenticate using the OIDC provider</p> </li> <li> <p>A list of tags that are attached to the specified IAM OIDC provider</p> </li> <li> <p>A list of thumbprints of one or more server certificates that the IdP uses</p> </li> </ul> <p>You get all of this information from the OIDC IdP you want to use to access Amazon Web Services.</p> <note> <p>Amazon Web Services secures communication with some OIDC identity providers (IdPs) through our library of trusted root certificate authorities (CAs) instead of using a certificate thumbprint to verify your IdP server certificate. These OIDC IdPs include Auth0, GitHub, Google, and those that use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint. In these cases, your legacy thumbprint remains in your configuration, but is no longer used for validation.</p> </note> <note> <p>The trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the IAM provider that this operation creates. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the <a>CreateOpenIDConnectProvider</a> operation to highly privileged users.</p> </note>",
