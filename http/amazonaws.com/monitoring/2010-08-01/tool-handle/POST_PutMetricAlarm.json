  "description": "<p>Creates or updates an alarm and associates it with the specified metric, metric math expression, anomaly detection model, or Metrics Insights query. For more information about using a Metrics Insights query for an alarm, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create_Metrics_Insights_Alarm.html\">Create alarms on Metrics Insights queries</a>.</p> <p>Alarms based on anomaly detection models cannot have Auto Scaling actions.</p> <p>When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to <code>INSUFFICIENT_DATA</code>. The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed.</p> <p>When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.</p> <p>If you are an IAM user, you must have Amazon EC2 permissions for some alarm operations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The <code>iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole</code> permission for all alarms with EC2 actions</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole</code> permissions to create an alarm with Systems Manager OpsItem or response plan actions.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The first time you create an alarm in the Amazon Web Services Management Console, the CLI, or by using the PutMetricAlarm API, CloudWatch creates the necessary service-linked role for you. The service-linked roles are called <code>AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchEvents</code> and <code>AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchAlarms_ActionSSM</code>. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role\">Amazon Web Services service-linked role</a>.</p> <p>Each <code>PutMetricAlarm</code> action has a maximum uncompressed payload of 120 KB.</p> <p> <b>Cross-account alarms</b> </p> <p>You can set an alarm on metrics in the current account, or in another account. To create a cross-account alarm that watches a metric in a different account, you must have completed the following pre-requisites:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The account where the metrics are located (the <i>sharing account</i>) must already have a sharing role named <b>CloudWatch-CrossAccountSharingRole</b>. If it does not already have this role, you must create it using the instructions in <b>Set up a sharing account</b> in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Cross-Account-Cross-Region.html#enable-cross-account-cross-Region\"> Cross-account cross-Region CloudWatch console</a>. The policy for that role must grant access to the ID of the account where you are creating the alarm. </p> </li> <li> <p>The account where you are creating the alarm (the <i>monitoring account</i>) must already have a service-linked role named <b>AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchCrossAccount</b> to allow CloudWatch to assume the sharing role in the sharing account. If it does not, you must create it following the directions in <b>Set up a monitoring account</b> in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Cross-Account-Cross-Region.html#enable-cross-account-cross-Region\"> Cross-account cross-Region CloudWatch console</a>.</p> </li> </ul>",
