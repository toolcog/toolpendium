Depending on the job type you specified when you initiated the job, the output will be either the content of an archive or a vault inventory.</p> <p>You can download all the job output or download a portion of the output by specifying a byte range. In the case of an archive retrieval job, depending on the byte range you specify, Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) returns the checksum for the portion of the data. You can compute the checksum on the client and verify that the values match to ensure the portion you downloaded is the correct data.</p> <p>A job ID will not expire for at least 24 hours after Glacier completes the job. That a byte range. For both archive and inventory retrieval jobs, you should verify the downloaded size against the size returned in the headers from the <b>Get Job Output</b> response.</p> <p>For archive retrieval jobs, you should also verify that the size is what you expected. If you download a portion of the output, the expected size is based on the range of bytes you specified. For example, if you specify a range of <code>bytes=0-1048575</code>, you should verify your download size is 1,048,576 bytes. If you download an entire archive, the expected size is the size of the archive when you uploaded it to Amazon S3 Glacier The expected size is also returned in the headers from the <b>Get Job Output</b> response.</p> <p>In the case of an archive retrieval job, depending on the byte range you specify, Glacier returns the checksum for the portion of the data.

You use the following process to download the job output:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Download a 128 MB chunk of output by specifying the appropriate byte range. Verify that all 128 MB of data was received.</p> </li> <li> <p>Along with the data, the response includes a SHA256 tree hash of the payload.
