  title: Route53 Recovery Cluster
  description: '<p>Welcome to the Routing Control (Recovery Cluster) API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller.</p> <p>With Route 53 ARC, you can use routing control with extreme reliability to recover applications by rerouting traffic across Availability Zones or Amazon Web Services Regions. Routing controls are simple on/off switches hosted on a highly available cluster in Route 53 ARC. A cluster provides a set of five redundant Regional endpoints against which you can run API calls to get or update the state of routing controls. To implement failover, you set one routing control On and another one Off, to reroute traffic from one Availability Zone or Amazon Web Services Region to another. </p> <p> <i>Be aware that you must specify a Regional endpoint for a cluster when you work with API cluster operations to get or update routing control states in Route 53 ARC.</i> In addition, you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region for Route 53 ARC API calls. For example, use the parameter <code>--region us-west-2</code> with AWS CLI commands. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.update.api.html"> Get and update routing control states using the API</a> in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.</p> <p>This API guide includes information about the API operations for how to get and update routing control states in Route 53 ARC. To work with routing control in Route 53 ARC, you must first create the required components (clusters, control panels, and routing controls) using the recovery cluster configuration API.</p> <p>For more information about working with routing control in Route 53 ARC, see the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create clusters, control panels, and routing controls by using API operations. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/recovery-cluster/latest/api/">Recovery Control Configuration API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Learn about the components in recovery control, including clusters, routing controls, and control panels, and how to work with Route 53 ARC in the Amazon Web Services console. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/introduction-components.html#introduction-components-routing"> Recovery control components</a> in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.</p> </li> <li> <p>Route 53 ARC also provides readiness checks that continually audit resources to help make sure that your applications are scaled and ready to handle failover traffic. For more information about the related API operations, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/recovery-readiness/latest/api/">Recovery Readiness API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>For more information about creating resilient applications and preparing for recovery readiness with Route 53 ARC, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/">Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide</a>.</p> </li> </ul>'

For example, you might want to fail over quickly for disaster recovery, and one or more safety rules might be unexpectedly preventing you from updating a routing control state to reroute traffic. In a "break glass" scenario like this, you can override one or more safety rules to change a routing control state and fail over your application.</p> <p>The <code>SafetyRulesToOverride</code> property enables you override one or more safety rules and update routing control states. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.override-safety-rule.html"> Override safety rules to reroute traffic</a> in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.</p> <p> <i>You must specify Regional endpoints when you work with API cluster operations to get or update routing control states in Route 53 ARC.</i> </p> <p>To see a code example for getting a routing control state, including accessing Regional cluster endpoints in sequence, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/service_code_examples_actions.html">API examples</a> in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.update.html"> Viewing and updating routing control states</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.html">Working with routing controls overall</a> </p> </li> </ul>'
