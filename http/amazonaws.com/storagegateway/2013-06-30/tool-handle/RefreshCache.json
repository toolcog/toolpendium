This operation finds objects in the Amazon S3 bucket that were added, removed, or replaced since the gateway last listed the bucket's contents and cached the results. This operation does not import files into the S3 File Gateway cache storage. It only updates the cached inventory to reflect changes in the inventory of the objects in the S3 bucket. This operation is only supported in the S3 File Gateway types.</p> <p>You can subscribe to be notified through an Amazon CloudWatch event when your <code>RefreshCache</code> operation completes. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/monitoring-file-gateway.html#get-notification\">Getting notified about file operations</a> in the <i>Storage Gateway User Guide</i>. This operation is Only supported for S3 File Gateways.</p> <p>When this API is called, it only initiates the refresh operation. When the API call completes and returns a success code, it doesn't necessarily mean that the file refresh has completed. You should use the refresh-complete notification to determine that the operation has completed before you check for new files on the gateway file share. You can subscribe to be notified through a CloudWatch event when your <code>RefreshCache</code> operation completes.</p> <p>Throttle limit: This API is asynchronous, so the gateway will accept no more than two refreshes at any time. We recommend using the refresh-complete CloudWatch event notification before issuing additional requests.
