Use Force include renditions to specify one or more resolutions to include your ABR stack. * (Recommended) To optimize automated ABR, specify as few resolutions as possible. * (Required) The number of resolutions that you specify must be equal to, or less than, the Max renditions setting. * If you specify a Min top rendition size rule, specify at least one resolution that is equal to, or greater than, Min top rendition size. * If you specify a Min bottom rendition size rule, only specify resolutions that are equal to, or greater than, Min bottom rendition size. * If you specify a Force include renditions rule, do not specify a separate rule for Allowed renditions. * Note: The ABR stack may include other resolutions that you do not specify here, depending on the Max renditions setting. Use Allowed renditions to specify a list of possible resolutions in your ABR stack. * (Required) The number of resolutions that you specify must be equal to, or greater than, the Max renditions setting. * MediaConvert will create an ABR stack exclusively from the list of resolutions that you specify. * Some resolutions in the Allowed renditions list may not be included, however you can force a resolution to be included by setting Required to ENABLED. * You must specify at least one resolution that is greater than or equal to any resolutions that you specify in Min top rendition size or Min bottom rendition size. * If you specify Allowed renditions, you must not specify a separate rule for Force include renditions."

HDR to SDR conversion uses tone mapping to approximate the outcome of manually regrading from HDR to SDR. When you specify an output color space, MediaConvert uses the following color space metadata, which includes color primaries, transfer characteristics, and matrix coefficients:\n  * HDR 10: BT.2020, PQ, BT.2020 non-constant\n  * HLG 2020: BT.2020, HLG, BT.2020 non-constant\n  * P3DCI (Theater): DCIP3, SMPTE 428M, BT.709\n  * P3D65 (SDR): Display P3, sRGB, BT.709\n  * P3D65 (HDR): Display P3, PQ, BT.709"

MediaConvert automatically applies this mode for HLG sources, regardless of your choice. For a bright and saturated output: Choose Vibrant. We recommend that you choose this mode when any of your source content is HDR10, and for the best results when it is mastered for 1000 nits.

To make sure that your video, audio, captions, and markers are synchronized and that time-based features, such as image inserter, work correctly, choose the Timecode source option that matches your assets. All timecodes are in a 24-hour format with frame number (HH:MM:SS:FF). * Embedded - Use the timecode that is in the input video. If no embedded timecode is in the source, the service will use Start at 0 instead. * Start at 0 - Set the timecode of the initial frame to 00:00:00:00. * Specified Start - Set the timecode of the initial frame to a value other than zero. You use Start timecode to provide this value."
