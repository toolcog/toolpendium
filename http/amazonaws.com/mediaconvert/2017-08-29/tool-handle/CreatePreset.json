After padding or trimming, the audio stream duration is no more than one frame longer than the video stream. MediaConvert applies audio padding or trimming only to the end of the last segment of the output. For unsegmented outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only to the end of the file.

Otherwise, we recommend that you adjust the softness of your output by using a lower value for the setting Sharpness or by enabling a noise reducer filter. The Softness setting specifies the quantization matrices that the encoder uses. Keep the default value, 0, for flat quantization. Choose the value 1 or 16 to use the default JVT softening quantization matricies from the H.264 specification. Choose a value from 17 to 128 to use planar interpolation. Increasing values from 17 to 128 result in increasing reduction of high-frequency data. The value 128 results in the softest video."
