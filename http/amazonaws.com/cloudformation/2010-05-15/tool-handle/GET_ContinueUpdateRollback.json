For example, you might have a stack that's rolling back to an old database instance that was deleted outside of CloudFormation. Because CloudFormation doesn't know the database was deleted, it assumes that the database instance still exists and attempts to roll back to it, causing the update rollback to fail.</p>",

You can specify only resources that are in the <code>UPDATE_FAILED</code> state because a rollback failed. You can't specify resources that are in the <code>UPDATE_FAILED</code> state for other reasons, for example, because an update was canceled. To check why a resource update failed, use the <a>DescribeStackResources</a> action, and view the resource status reason.</p> <important> <p>Specify this property to skip rolling back resources that CloudFormation can't successfully roll back. We recommend that you <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-errors-update-rollback-failed\"> troubleshoot</a> resources before skipping them. CloudFormation sets the status of the specified resources to <code>UPDATE_COMPLETE</code> and continues to roll back the stack. After the rollback is complete, the state of the skipped resources will be inconsistent with the state of the resources in the stack template. Before performing another stack update, you must update the stack or resources to be consistent with each other. If you don't, subsequent stack updates might fail, and the stack will become unrecoverable.</p> </important> <p>Specify the minimum number of resources required to successfully roll back your stack. For example, a failed resource update might cause dependent resources to fail. In this case, it might not be necessary to skip the dependent resources.</p> <p>To skip resources that are part of nested stacks, use the following format: <code>NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID</code>. If you want to specify the logical ID of a stack resource (<code>Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack</code>) in the <code>ResourcesToSkip</code> list, then its corresponding embedded stack must be in one of the following states: <code>DELETE_IN_PROGRESS</code>, <code>DELETE_COMPLETE</code>, or <code>DELETE_FAILED</code>.</p> <note> <p>Don't confuse a child stack's name with its corresponding logical ID defined in the parent stack.
