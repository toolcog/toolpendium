If `bundles` is true, then all configured bundles have been activated. If `plugins` is true, then all plugins are in an 'OK' state.\n- **500** - OPA service is *not* healthy. If `bundles` is true, at least one of configured bundles has not yet been activated. If `plugins` is true, at least one plugins is in a 'not OK' state.\n\n---\n**Note**\nThis check is only for initial bundle activation. Subsequent downloads will not affect the health check.\n\nUse the **status** endpoint (in the (management API)[management.html]) for more fine-grained bundle status monitoring.\n\n---",
