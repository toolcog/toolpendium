  "description": "This endpoint provides an easy way to get a feed of all the publicly published posts on trash nothing. It provides access to all publicly published offer and wanted posts from the last 30 days. The posts are sorted by date (newest first). <br /><br /> There are fewer options for filtering, sorting and searching posts with this endpoint but there is no 1,000 post limit and posts that are crossposted to multiple groups are not merged together in the response.  In most cases, crossposted posts are easy to detect because they have the same user_id, title and content.\n",
