  "description": "This endpoint provides an easy way to get a feed of all the changes that have been made to publicly published posts on trash nothing.  Similar to the /posts/all endpoint, only data from the last 30 days is available and the changes are sorted by date (newest first).  Every change includes the date of the change, the post_id of the post that was changed and the type of change. <br /><br /> The different types of changes that are returned are listed below. <br /><br /> - deleted<br /> - undeleted<br /> - satisfied<br /> - promised<br /> - unpromised<br /> - withdrawn<br /> - edited<br /> <br /> For edited changes, clients can use the retrieve post API endpoint to get the edits that have been made to the post.\n",
