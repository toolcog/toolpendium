  "description": "This method lets you\n[search for envelopes](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/envelopes/)\nin your accounts.\nA large set of filters let you narrow the scope of your search\nby date,\nby envelope ID,\nor by status codes.\nYour request must include one or more of the following parameters:\n\n* `from_date`\n* `envelope_ids`\n* `transaction_ids`\n\n\nTo avoid unnecessary database queries, the DocuSign\nsignature platform first checks requests to ensure that the\nfilter set supplied does not result in a zero-size response\nbefore querying the database.\n\nFor example, for a request with a `from_to_status` of\n`delivered` and a current `status` of `created,sent`,\nDocuSign will always return an empty list.\nThis is because the request translates to: find the\nenvelopes that were delivered between the `from_date` and\n`to_date` dates that have a current status of `created` or\n`sent`. Since an envelope that has been delivered can\nnever have a status of `created` or `sent`, a zero-size\nresponse would be generated.\nIn this case, DocuSign does not query the database\nand returns an empty list immediately.\n\nGetting envelope status using `transaction_ids` is useful\nfor offline signing situations where it can be used\ndetermine if an envelope was created or not. It can be used\nfor the cases where a network connection was lost, before\nthe envelope status could be returned.\n\n\nThe following table shows the valid current envelope\nstatuses (`status` parameter) for the different status\nqualifiers (`from_to_status` parameter) in the request. If\nthe status and status qualifiers in the API request do not\ncontain any of the values shown in the Valid Current\nStatuses column, then an empty list is returned.\n\nClient applications should check that the statuses (`status`\nparameter) they are requesting make sense for a given\n`from_to_status` parameter value.\n\n| Status Qualifier<br>(`from_to_status`) | Effective Status Qualifier | Valid Current Statuses                                                      |\n| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| any (changed)                          | StatusChanged              | any, created, sent, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted |\n| created                                | Created                    | any, created, sent, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted |\n| sent                                   | Sent                       | any, sent, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted          |\n| delivered                              | StatusChanged              | any, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted                |\n| signed                                 | StatusChanged              | any, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted                           |\n| completed                              | Completed                  | any, completed, declined, voided, deleted                                   |\n| declined                               | StatusChanged              | any, declined, voided, deleted                                              |\n| timedout<br>always return zero results | StatusChanged              | any, voided, deleted                                                        |\n| voided                                 | Voided                     | any, voided, deleted                                                        |\n| deleted                                | StatusChanged              | any, deleted                                                                |\n\n## Extraneous results\n\nIn some cases, a request for a specific envelope status will\ninclude envelopes with additional statuses. For example, in\na request with a `from_date` of 2017-01-01, a `to_date` of\n2017-01-07 and the status qualifier (`from_to_status`) set\nto `delivered`, the response set might contain envelopes\nthat were created during that time period, but not delivered\nduring the time period. As a workaround, check the envelope\nstatus values in the result set as needed.\n\n\n### Related topics\n\n- [Searching for envelopes](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/envelopes/search/)\n- [How to list envelope status changes](/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/list-envelope-status-changes/)\n",
