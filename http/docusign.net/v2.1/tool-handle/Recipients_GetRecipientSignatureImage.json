  "description": "Retrieves the specified user signature image. The image is returned in the same format as uploaded. In the request you can specify if the chrome (the added line and identifier around the initial image) is returned with the image.\n\nThe userId specified in the endpoint must match the authenticated user's user ID and the user must be a member of the account.\n\nThe `signatureIdOrName` parameter accepts signature ID or signature name. DocuSign recommends you use signature ID (`signatureId`), since some names contain characters that don't properly URL encode. If you use the user name, it is likely that the name includes spaces and you might need to URL encode the name before using it in the endpoint. \n\nFor example: \"Bob Smith\" to \"Bob%20Smith\"\n\nOlder envelopes might only have chromed images. If getting the non-chromed image fails, try getting the chromed image.",
