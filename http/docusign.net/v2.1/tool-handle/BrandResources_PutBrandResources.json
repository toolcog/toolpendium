Example:\n\n`Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"DocuSign_SigningResource_4328673.xml\"`\n\n**Note:** Branding for either signing or sending must be enabled for the account (`canSelfBrandSend` , `canSelfBrandSign`, or both of these account settings must be **true**).\n\n**Important:** Customizing resource files is an advanced branding configuration option which can significantly impact your account, and should be done only by someone with expertise in XML and HTML. The master resource files are subject to change without notice. If you customize your resource files, after each release, DocuSign recommends you review any changes and update your custom files as needed.\n\nWhen you upload a modified resource file, only the elements that differ from the master resource file are saved as your resource file. Similarly, when you download your resource files, only the modified elements are included in the file.",
