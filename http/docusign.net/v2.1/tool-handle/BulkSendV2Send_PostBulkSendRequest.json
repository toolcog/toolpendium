  "name": "BulkSendV2Send_PostBulkSendRequest",
  "description": "This method initiates the bulk send process. It generates a bulk send request based on an [existing bulk send list][create_list] and an envelope or template.\n\nConsider using the [BulkSend::createBulkSendTestRequest][create_test] method to test your bulk send list for compatibility with the envelope or template that you want to send first. To learn about the complete bulk send flow, see the [Bulk Send overview][BulkSendOverview].\n\nIf the envelopes were successfully queued for asynchronous processing, the response contains a `batchId` that you can use to get the status of the batch. If a failure occurs, the API returns an error message.\n\n**Note:** Partial success or failure generally does not occur. Only the entire batch is queued for asynchronous processing.\n\n### Related topics\n\n- [How to bulk send envelopes](/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/bulk-send-envelopes/)\n\n\n### Errors\n\nThis method returns the following errors:\n\n| Error code                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| :--------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| BULK_SEND_ENVELOPE_NOT_IN_SENDABLE_STATE                   | Envelope {0} is not in a sendable state.
