  "description": "Adds a chunk or part to an existing chunked upload. After you use the Create method to initiate a new chunked upload and upload the first part, \nuse this method to upload subsequent parts.\n\nFor simplicity, DocuSign recommends that you upload the parts in their sequential order ( 1,2, 3, 4, etc.). The Create method adds the first part and assigns it the `sequence` value `0`. As a result, DocuSign recommends that you start with a `sequence` value of `1` when you use this method, and continue uploading parts contiguously until you have uploaded the entirety of the original content to DocuSign.\n\nExample:\n\n\n```\nPUT /v2.1/accounts/{accountId}/chunked_uploads/{chunkedUploadId}/1\nPUT /v2.1/accounts/{accountId}/chunked_uploads/{chunkedUploadId}/2\nPUT /v2.1/accounts/{accountId}/chunked_uploads/{chunkedUploadId}/3\n```\n\n**Note:** You cannot replace a part that DocuSign has already received, or add parts to a chunked upload that is already successfully committed.",
