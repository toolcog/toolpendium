  "description": "Delete the delayed routing object for an envelope's workflow step. You cannot call this endpoint once the delay is in progress. As a workaround, you can update the delay or send time to one minute in the future using the [updateEnvelopeDelayedRoutingDefinition](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopeworkflowdefinition/updateEnvelopeDelayedRoutingDefinition/) endpoint. \n\n**Note:** After deleting the delayed routing object, the workflow step still contains the `pause_before` action. Once the workflow step is reached, you will need to [unpause the envelope](/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/unpause-workflow/). If you want to delete the step entirely, use [deleteEnvelopeWorkflowStepDefinition](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopeworkflowdefinition/deleteenvelopeworkflowstepdefinition/) instead.\n",
