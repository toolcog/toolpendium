  "description": "Returns a URL that enables you to embed the edit view of the DocuSign UI in your applications. This is a one-time use login token that allows the user to be placed into the DocuSign editing view.  Upon sending completion, the user is returned to the return URL provided by the API application.\n\nSee [Embedded signing and sending](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/embedding/)\nto learn more about embedding.\n\nDue to screen space issues,\ndo not use an `<iframe>` for embedded operations on mobile devices.\nFor iOS devices, DocuSign recommends using a WebView.\n\n### Revoking the URL\n\nYou can revoke this URL by making\na DELETE HTTP request to the URL\nwith no request body.\n\n## Information security notice\n\nThis method provides full access to the sending account. When you\nuse this view, the current user has full access to the account.\nIf the account has administrative privileges, then this method\nalso provides administrator access.\n\nIf your use case needs to enable a sender to update a draft envelope before it is sent or make other changes, take one of the following steps:\n\n- Configure each sender to have their own individual user account to use this API method.</li>\n- Enhance your API integration so that this method is not needed. Your integration can create the tabs, recipients, and other envelope settings as needed.</li>\n\n### Related topics\n\n- [Embedded signing and sending](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/embedding/)\n- [How to send an envelope via your app](/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/embedded-sending/)\n- [How to embed the DocuSign UI in your app](/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/embed-ui/)\n",
