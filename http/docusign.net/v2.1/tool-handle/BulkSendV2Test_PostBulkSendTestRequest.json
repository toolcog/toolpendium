  "description": "This method tests a bulk send list for compatibility with the envelope or template that you want to send. For example, a template that has three roles is not compatible with a bulk send list that has only two recipients. For this reason, you might want to test compatibility first.\n\nA successful test result returns `true` for the `canBeSent` property. An unsuccessful test returns a JSON response that contains information about the errors that occurred.\n\nIf the test is successful, you can then send the envelope or template by using the [BulkSend::createBulkSendRequest][BulkSendRequest] method.\n\n## Envelope Compatibility Checks\n\nThis section describes the envelope compatibility checks that the system performs.\n\n**Top-Level Issues**\n\n- Envelopes must be in a sendable state.\n- The bulk send list must contain at least one copy (instance of an envelope), and no more than the maximum number of copies allowed for the account.\n- The envelope must not be null and must be visible to the current user.\n- The account cannot have more queued envelopes than the maximum number configured for the account.\n- The bulk send list must exist.\n\n**Recipients**\n\n- The envelope must have recipients.\n- If you are using an envelope, all of the recipients defined in the bulk send list must have corresponding recipient IDs in the envelope definition. If you are using a template, you must either match the recipient IDs or role IDs.\n- The envelope cannot contain a bulk recipient (an artifact of the legacy version of DocuSign's bulk send\n  functionality).\n\n**Recipient Tabs**\n\n- Every `recipient ID, tab label` pair in the bulk send list must correspond to a tab in the envelope.\n\n**Custom Fields**\n\n- Each envelope-level custom field in the bulk send list must correspond to the name of a `customField` in the\n  envelope definition. You do not have to match the recipient-level custom fields.\n\n[BulkSendRequest]:  /docs/esign-rest-api/reference/bulkenvelopes/bulksend/createbulksendrequest/\n\n\n",
