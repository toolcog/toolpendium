  "description": "Account administrators can use this method to perform the following tasks:\n\n- Customize values in the default disclosure.\n- Switch to a custom disclosure that uses your own text and HTML formatting.\n- Change values in your existing consumer disclosure. \n\nTo specify the signer language version of the disclosure that you are updating, use the optional `langCode` query parameter.\n\n**Note:** Only account administrators can use this method. Each time you change the disclosure content, all unsigned recipients of outstanding documents will be required to accept a new version. \n\n## Updating the default disclosure\n\nWhen you update the default disclosure, you can edit all properties except for the following ones:\n\n- `accountEsignId`: This property is read-only.\n- `custom`: The default value is **false.** Editing this property causes the default disclosure to switch to a custom disclosure.\n- `esignAgreement`: This property is read-only.\n- `esignText`: You cannot edit this property when `custom` is set to **false.** The API returns a 200 OK HTTP response, but does not update the `esignText`.\n- Metadata properties: These properties are read-only.\n\n**Note:** The text of the default disclosure is always in English.\n\n## Switching to a custom disclosure\n\nTo switch to a custom disclosure, set the `custom` property to **true** and customize the value for the `eSignText` property. \n\nYou can also edit all of the other properties except for the following ones:\n\n- `accountEsignId`: This property is read-only.\n- `esignAgreement`: This property is read-only.\n- Metadata properties: These properties are read-only.\n\n**Note:** When you use a custom disclosure, you can create versions of it in different signer languages and se the `langCode` parameter to specify the signer language version that you are updating.\n\n**Important:**  When you switch from a default to a custom disclosure, note the following information:\n\n- You will not be able to return to using the default disclosure.\n- Only the disclosure for the currently selected signer language is saved. DocuSign will not automatically translate your custom disclosure. You must create a disclosure for each language that your signers use.\n\n## Updating a custom disclosure\n\nWhen you update a custom disclosure, you can update all of the properties except for the following ones:\n\n- `accountEsignId`: This property is read-only. \n- `esignAgreement`: This property is read-only.\n- Metadata properties: These properties are read-only.\n\n**Important:** Only the disclosure for the currently selected signer language is saved.
