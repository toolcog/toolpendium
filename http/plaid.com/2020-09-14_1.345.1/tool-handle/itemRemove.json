  "description": "The `/item/remove` endpoint allows you to remove an Item. Once removed, the `access_token`, as well as any processor tokens or bank account tokens associated with the Item, is no longer valid and cannot be used to access any data that was associated with the Item.\n\nNote that in the Development environment, issuing an `/item/remove`  request will not decrement your live credential count. To increase your credential account in Development, contact Support.\n\nAlso note that for certain OAuth-based institutions, an Item removed via `/item/remove` may still show as an active connection in the institution's OAuth permission manager.\n\nAPI versions 2019-05-29 and earlier return a `removed` boolean as part of the response.",
