  "description": "As an alternative to adding Items via Link, you can also use the `/transfer/migrate_account` endpoint to migrate known account and routing numbers to Plaid Items.  Note that Items created in this way are not compatible with endpoints for other products, such as `/accounts/balance/get`, and can only be used with Transfer endpoints.  If you require access to other endpoints, create the Item through Link instead.  Access to `/transfer/migrate_account` is not enabled by default; to obtain access, contact your Plaid Account Manager.",
