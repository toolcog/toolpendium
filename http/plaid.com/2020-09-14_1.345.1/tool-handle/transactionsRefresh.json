  "description": "`/transactions/refresh` is an optional endpoint for users of the Transactions product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for an Item. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur multiple times a day for any Transactions-enabled Item. If changes to transactions are discovered after calling `/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: for `/transactions/sync` users, [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed. For users of both `/transactions/sync` and `/transactions/get`, [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling `/transactions/get` or `/transactions/sync`. Note that the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint is not supported for Capital One (`ins_128026`) and will result in a `PRODUCT_NOT_SUPPORTED` error if called on an Item from that institution.\n\n`/transactions/refresh` is offered as an add-on to Transactions and has a separate [fee model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee). To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.",
