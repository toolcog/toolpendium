  "description": "The `/sandbox/item/fire_webhook` endpoint is used to test that code correctly handles webhooks. This endpoint can trigger the following webhooks:\n\n`DEFAULT_UPDATE`: Transactions update webhook to be fired for a given Sandbox Item. If the Item does not support Transactions, a `SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED` error will result.\n\n`NEW_ACCOUNTS_AVAILABLE`: Webhook to be fired for a given Sandbox Item created with Account Select v2.\n\n`AUTH_DATA_UPDATE`: Webhook to be fired for a given Sandbox Item created with Auth as an enabled product.\n\n`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`: Recurring Transactions webhook to be fired for a given Sandbox Item. If the Item does not support Recurring Transactions, a `SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED` error will result.\n\n`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`: Transactions webhook to be fired for a given Sandbox Item.  If the Item does not support Transactions, a `SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED` error will result.\n\nNote that this endpoint is provided for developer ease-of-use and is not required for testing webhooks; webhooks will also fire in Sandbox under the same conditions that they would in Production or Development.",
