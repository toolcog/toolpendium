Credit transfers decrease this balance when they are created.\n\nThe transactable balance shows the amount in your account that you are able to use for transfers, and is essentially your available balance minus your minimum balance.\n\nNote that this endpoint can only be used with FBO accounts, when using Bank Transfers in the Full Service configuration. It cannot be used on your own account when using Bank Transfers in the BTS Platform configuration.",
