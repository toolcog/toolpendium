  "description": "The `/accounts/balance/get` endpoint returns the real-time balance for each of an Item's accounts. While other endpoints may return a balance object, only `/accounts/balance/get` forces the available and current balance fields to be refreshed rather than cached. This endpoint can be used for existing Items that were added via any of Plaid’s other products. This endpoint can be used as long as Link has been initialized with any other product, `balance` itself is not a product that can be used to initialize Link. As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints; if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.",
