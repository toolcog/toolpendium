It can be called once the status of the verification has been set to `VERIFICATION_STATUS_PROCESSING_COMPLETE`, as reported by the `INCOME: verification_status` webhook. Attempting to call the endpoint before verification has been completed will result in an error.\n\nThis endpoint has been deprecated; new integrations should use `/credit/payroll_income/get` instead.",
