  "description": "The `/asset_report/pdf/get` endpoint retrieves the Asset Report in PDF format. Before calling `/asset_report/pdf/get`, you must first create the Asset Report using `/asset_report/create` (or filter an Asset Report using `/asset_report/filter`) and then wait for the [`PRODUCT_READY`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#product_ready) webhook to fire, indicating that the Report is ready to be retrieved.\n\nThe response to `/asset_report/pdf/get` is the PDF binary data. The `request_id`  is returned in the `Plaid-Request-ID` header.\n\nIf report_type was set to `VERIFICATION_OF_EMPLOYMENT` when the Asset Report was created in asset_report/create, debit transactions and transaction amounts wonâ€™t be included in the report.\n\n[View a sample PDF Asset Report](https://plaid.com/documents/sample-asset-report.pdf).",
