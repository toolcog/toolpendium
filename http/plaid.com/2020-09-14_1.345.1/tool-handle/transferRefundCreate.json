  "description": "Use the `/transfer/refund/create` endpoint to create a refund for a transfer. A transfer can be refunded if the transfer was initiated in the past 180 days.\n\nProcessing of the refund will not occur until at least 3 business days following the transfer's settlement date, plus any hold/settlement delays. This 3-day window helps better protect your business from regular ACH returns. Consumer initiated returns (unauthorized returns) could still happen for about 60 days from the settlement date. If the original transfer is canceled, returned or failed, all pending refunds will automatically be canceled. Processed refunds cannot be revoked.",
