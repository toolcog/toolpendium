  "description": "Use the `/sandbox/transfer/test_clock/advance` endpoint to advance a `test_clock` in the Sandbox environment.\n\nA test clock object represents an independent timeline and has a `virtual_time` field indicating the current timestamp of the timeline. A test clock can be advanced by incrementing `virtual_time`, but may never go back to a lower `virtual_time`.\n\nIf a test clock is advanced, we will simulate the changes that ought to occur during the time that elapsed.\nFor instance, a client creates a weekly recurring transfer with a test clock set at t. When the client advances the test clock by setting `virtual_time` = t + 15 days, 2 new originations should be created, along with the webhook events.\n\nThe advancement of the test clock from its current `virtual_time` should be limited such that there are no more than 20 originations resulting from the advance operation on each `recurring_transfer` associated with the `test_clock`.\nFor instance, if the recurring transfer associated with this test clock originates once every 4 weeks, you can advance the `virtual_time` up to 80 weeks on each API call.",
