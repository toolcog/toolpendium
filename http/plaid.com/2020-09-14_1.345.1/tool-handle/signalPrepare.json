  "description": "When Link is not initialized with Signal, call `/signal/prepare` to opt-in that Item to the Signal data collection process, developing a Signal score.\n\nIf you are using other Plaid products after Link, e.g. Identity or Assets, call `/signal/prepare` after those product calls are complete.\n\nExample flow: Link is initialized with Auth, call `/auth/get` for the account and routing number, call `/identity/get` to retrieve bank ownership details, then call `/signal/prepare` to begin Signal data collection. Later, once you have obtained details about the proposed transaction from the user, call `/signal/evaluate` for a Signal score. For more information please see [Recommendations for initializing Link with specific product combinations](https://www.plaid.com/docs/link/initializing-products/#recommendations-for-initializing-link-with-specific-product-combinations).",
