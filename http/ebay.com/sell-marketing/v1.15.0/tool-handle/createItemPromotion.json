  "description": "This method creates an <b>item promotion</b>, where the buyer receives a discount when they meet the buying criteria that's set for the promotion. Known here as \"threshold promotions\", these promotions trigger when a threshold is met.  <p>eBay highlights promoted items by placing teasers for the promoted items throughout the online buyer flows.</p>  <p><i>Discounts</i> are specified as either a monetary amount or a percentage off the standard sales price of a listing, letting you offer deals such as \"Buy 1 Get 1\" and \"Buy $50, get 20% off\".</p> <p><i>Volume pricing</i> promotions increase the value of the discount as the buyer increases the quantity they purchase.</p> <p><i>Coded Coupons</i> provide unique codes that a buyer can use during checkout to receive a discount. The seller can specify the number of times a buyer can use the coupon and the maximum amount across all purchases that can be discounted using the coupon. The coupon code can also be made public (appearing on the seller's Offer page, search pages, the item listing, and the checkout page) or private (only on the seller's Offer page, but the seller can include the code in email and social media).</p> <p class=\"tablenote\"><b>Note</b>: Coded Coupons are currently available in the US, UK, DE, FR, IT, ES, and AU marketplaces.</p><p>There are two ways to add items to a threshold promotion:</p>  <ul><li><b>Key-based promotions</b> select items using either the listing IDs or inventory reference IDs of the items you want to promote. Note that if you use inventory reference IDs, you must specify both the <b>inventoryReferenceId</b> and the associated <b>inventoryReferenceType</b> of the item(s) you want to include the promotion.</li> <li><b>Rule-based promotions</b> select items using a list of eBay category IDs or seller Store category IDs. Rules can further constrain items in a promotion by minimum and maximum prices, brands, and item conditions.</li></ul>  <p>You must create a new promotion in either a <code>DRAFT</code> or <code>SCHEDULED</code> state. Use the DRAFT state when you are initially creating a promotion and you want to be sure it's correctly configured before scheduling it to run. When you create a promotion, the promotion ID is returned in the <b>Location</b> response header. Use this ID to reference the promotion in subsequent requests.</p>  <p class=\"tablenote\"><b>Tip:</b> Refer to the <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/promotions-manager.html\">Selling Integration Guide</a> for details and examples showing how to create and manage threshold promotions using the Promotions Manager.</p>  <p>For information on the eBay marketplaces that support item promotions, see <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PM-requirements\">Promotions Manager requirements and restrictions</a>.</p>",
