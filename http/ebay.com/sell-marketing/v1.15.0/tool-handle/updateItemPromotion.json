Indicate the promotion you want to update using the <b>promotion_id</b> path parameter.  <p>Call <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/resources/promotion/methods/getPromotions\">getPromotions</a> to retrieve the IDs of a seller's promotions.</p>  <p>When updating a promotion, supply all the fields that you used to configure the original promotion (and not just the fields you are updating). eBay replaces the specified promotion with the values you supply in the update request and if you don't pass a field that currently has a value, the update request will fail.</p>  <p>The parameters you are allowed to update with this request depend on the status of the promotion you're updating:  <ul><li>DRAFT or SCHEDULED promotions: You can update any of the parameters in these promotions that have not yet started to run, including the <b>discountRules</b>.</li> <li>RUNNING or PAUSED promotions: You can change the <b>endDate</b> and the item's inventory but you cannot change the promotional discount or the promotion's start date.</li> <li>ENDED promotions: Nothing can be changed.</li></ul> <p class=\"tablenote\"><b>Tip:</b> When updating a <code>RUNNING</code> or <code>PAUSED</code> promotion, set the <b>status</b> field to <code>SCHEDULED</code> for the update request.
