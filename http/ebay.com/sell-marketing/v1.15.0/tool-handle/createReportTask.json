This functionality will be decommissioned on April 3, 2023. See <a href=\"/develop/apis/api-deprecation-status\">API Deprecation Status</a> for details.</span><br /><br />This method creates a <i>report task</i>, which generates a Promoted Listings report based on the values specified in the call.<br /><br />The report is generated based on the criteria you specify, including the report type, the report's dimensions and metrics, the report's start and end dates, the listings to include in the report, and more. <i>Metrics </i>are the quantitative measurements in the report while <i>dimensions</i> specify the attributes of the data included in the reports.<br /><br />When creating a report task, you can specify the items you want included in the report. The items you specify, using either <b>listingId</b> or <b>inventoryReference</b> values, must be in a Promoted Listings campaign for them to be included in the report.<br /><br />For details on the required and optional fields for each report type, see <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/pl-reports.html\">Promoted Listings reporting</a>.<br /><br />This call returns the URL to the report task in the <b>Location</b> response header, and the URL includes the report-task ID.<br /><br />Reports often take time to generate and it's common for this call to return an HTTP status of <code>202</code>, which indicates the report is being generated. Call <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/resources/ad_report_task/methods/getReportTasks\">getReportTasks</a> (or <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/resources/ad_report_task/methods/getReportTask\">getReportTask</a> with the report-task ID) to determine the status of a Promoted Listings report. When a report is complete, eBay sets its status to <b>SUCCESS</b> and you can download it using the URL returned in the <b>reportHref</b> field of the <b>getReportTask</b> call. Report files are tab-separated value gzip files with a file extension of <code>.tsv.gz</code>.<br/><br/><span class=\"tablenote\"><b>Note:</b> The reporting of some data related to sales and ad-fees may require a 72-hour (<b>maximum</b>) adjustment period which is often referred to as the <i>Reconciliation Period</i>. Such adjustment periods should, on average, be minimal. However, at any given time, the <b>payments</b> tab may be used to view those amounts that have actually been charged.</span><br /><span class=\"tablenote\"><span style=\"color:#004680\"><strong>Note:</strong></span> This call fails if you don't submit all the required fields for the specified report type. Fields not supported by the specified report type are ignored.
