  "description": "This method pauses a currently-active (RUNNING) threshold promotion and changes the state of the promotion from <code>RUNNING</code> to <code>PAUSED</code>. Pausing a promotion makes the promotion temporarily unavailable to buyers and any currently-incomplete transactions will not receive the promotional offer until the promotion is resumed. Also, promotion teasers are not displayed when a promotion is paused.  <br><br>Pass the ID of the promotion you want to pause using the <b>promotion_id</b> path parameter. Call <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/resources/promotion/methods/getPromotions\">getPromotions</a> to retrieve the IDs of the seller's promotions. <br><br><b>Note:</b> You can only pause threshold promotions (you cannot pause markdown promotions).",
