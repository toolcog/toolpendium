When using this method, specify the <strong>feedType</strong> and <strong>filterCriteria</strong> including both <strong>evaluationMarketplaceId</strong> and <strong>customerServiceMetricType</strong> for the report. The method returns the location response header containing the call URI to use with <strong>getCustomerServiceMetricTask</strong> to retrieve status and details on the task.</p><p>Only CURRENT Customer Service Metrics reports can be generated with the Sell Feed API. PROJECTED reports are not supported at this time. See the <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/analytics/resources/customer_service_metric/methods/getCustomerServiceMetric\">getCustomerServiceMetric</a> method document in the Analytics API for more information about these two types of reports.</p><p><span class=\"tablenote\"><strong>Note:</strong> Before calling this API, retrieve the summary of the seller's performance and rating for the customer service metric by calling <strong>getCustomerServiceMetric</strong> (part of the <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/analytics/resources/methods\">Analytics API</a>). You can then populate the create task request fields with the values from the response. This technique eliminates failed tasks that request a report for a <strong>customerServiceMetricType</strong> and <strong>evaluationMarketplaceId</strong> that are without evaluation.</span></p>",
