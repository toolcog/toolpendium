  "description": "Returns a list of real-time servers that can be used for long-polling updates\nto the [event stream](#get-events).\n\nLong polling is the concept where a HTTP request is kept open until the\nserver sends a response, then repeating the process over and over to receive\nupdated responses.\n\nLong polling the event stream can only be used for user events, not for\nenterprise events.\n\nTo use long polling, first use this endpoint to retrieve a list of long poll\nURLs. Next, make a long poll request to any of the provided URLs.\n\nWhen an event occurs in monitored account a response with the value\n`new_change` will be sent. The response contains no other details as\nit only serves as a prompt to take further action such as sending a\nrequest to the [events endpoint](#get-events) with the last known\n`stream_position`.\n\nAfter the server sends this response it closes the connection. You must now\nrepeat the long poll process to begin listening for events again.\n\nIf no events occur for a while and the connection times out you will\nreceive a response with the value `reconnect`. When you receive this response\nyouâ€™ll make another call to this endpoint to restart the process.\n\nIf you receive no events in `retry_timeout` seconds then you will need to\nmake another request to the real-time server (one of the URLs in the response\nfor this endpoint). This might be necessary due to network errors.\n\nFinally, if you receive a `max_retries` error when making a request to the\nreal-time server, you should start over by making a call to this endpoint\nfirst.",
