  "description": "**This endpoint allows you to delete your spam reports.**\n\nDeleting a spam report will remove the suppression, meaning email will once again be sent to the previously suppressed address. This should be avoided unless a recipient indicates they wish to receive email from you again. You can use our [bypass filters](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/index-suppressions/#bypass-suppressions) to deliver messages to otherwise suppressed addresses when exceptions are required.\n\nThere are two options for deleting spam reports: \n\n1. You can delete all spam reports by setting the `delete_all` field to `true` in the request body.\n2. You can delete a list of select spam reports by specifying the email addresses in the `emails` array of the request body.",
