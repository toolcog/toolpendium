You can optionally filter the results as well as control their sort order and the number of results returned at a time.\n\nBy default, all labels are returned, 25 at a time, starting with the most recently created ones.  You can combine multiple filter options to narrow-down the results.  For example, if you only want to get your UPS labels for your east coast warehouse you could query by both `warehouse_id` and `carrier_id`\n",
