  "description": "#### &#128274; OAuth Required\n\nReturns collection progress for a show including details on all aired seasons and episodes. The `next_episode` will be the next episode the user should collect, if there are no upcoming episodes it will be set to `null`.\n\nBy default, any hidden seasons will be removed from the response and stats. To include these and adjust the completion stats, set the `hidden` flag to `true`.\n\nBy default, specials will be excluded from the response. Set the `specials` flag to `true` to include season 0 and adjust the stats accordingly. If you'd like to include specials, but not adjust the stats, set `count_specials` to `false`.\n\nBy default, the `last_episode` and `next_episode` are calculated using the last `aired` episode the user has collected, even if they've collected older episodes more recently. To use their last collected episode for these calculations, set the `last_activity` flag to `collected`.\n\n**Note:** Only aired episodes are used to calculate progress. Episodes in the future or without an air date are ignored.",
