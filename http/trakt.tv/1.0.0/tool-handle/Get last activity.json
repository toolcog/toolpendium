We recommended caching these dates locally, then you can compare to know exactly what data has changed recently. This can greatly optimize your syncs so you don't pull down a ton of data only to see nothing has actually changed.\n\n#### Account\n\n`settings_at` is set when the OAuth user updates any of their Trakt settings on the website. `followed_at` is set when another Trakt user follows or unfollows the OAuth user. `following_at` is set when the OAuth user follows or unfollows another Trakt user. `pending_at` is set when the OAuth user follows a private account, which requires their approval. `requested_at` is set when the OAuth user has a private account and someone requests to follow them.",
