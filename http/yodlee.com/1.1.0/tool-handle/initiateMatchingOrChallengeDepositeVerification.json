  "description": "The post verification service is used to initiate the matching service (MS) and the challenge deposit account verification (CDV) process to verify account ownership.<br>The MS and CDV process can verify ownership of only bank accounts (i.e., checking and savings).<br>The MS verification can be initiated only for an already aggregated account or a providerAccount.<br>The prerequisite for the MS verification process is to request the ACCT_PROFILE dataset with the HOLDER_NAME attribute.<br>In the MS verification process, a string-match of the account holder name with the registered user name is performed instantaneously. You can contact the Yodlee CustomerCare to configure the full name or only the last name match.<br>Once the CDV process is initiated Yodlee will post the microtransaction (i.e., credit and debit) in the user's account. The CDV process takes 2 to 3 days to complete as it requires the user to provide the microtransaction details.<br>The CDV process is currently supported only in the United States.<br>The verificationId in the response can be used to track the verification request.<br><br><b>Notes:</b><li>This endpoint cannot be used to test the CDV functionality in the developer sandbox or test environment. You will need a money transmitter license to implement the CDV functionality and also require the Yodlee Professional Services team's assistance to set up a dedicated environment.",
