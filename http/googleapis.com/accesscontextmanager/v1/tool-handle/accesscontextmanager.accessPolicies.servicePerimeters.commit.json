  "description": "Commits the dry-run specification for all the service perimeters in an access policy. A commit operation on a service perimeter involves copying its `spec` field to the `status` field of the service perimeter. Only service perimeters with `use_explicit_dry_run_spec` field set to true are affected by a commit operation. The long-running operation from this RPC has a successful status after the dry-run specifications for all the service perimeters have been committed. If a commit fails, it causes the long-running operation to return an error response and the entire commit operation is cancelled. When successful, the Operation.response field contains CommitServicePerimetersResponse. The `dry_run` and the `spec` fields are cleared after a successful commit operation.",
