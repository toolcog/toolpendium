To filter by role, set `role` to `ROLE_MEMBER` or `ROLE_MANAGER`. To filter by type, set `member.type` to `HUMAN` or `BOT`. To filter by both role and type, use the `AND` operator. To filter by either role or type, use the `OR` operator. For example, the following queries are valid: ``` role = \"ROLE_MANAGER\" OR role = \"ROLE_MEMBER\" member.type = \"HUMAN\" AND role = \"ROLE_MANAGER\" ``` The following queries are invalid: ``` member.type = \"HUMAN\" AND member.type = \"BOT\" role = \"ROLE_MANAGER\" AND role = \"ROLE_MEMBER\" ``` Invalid queries are rejected by the server with an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error."
