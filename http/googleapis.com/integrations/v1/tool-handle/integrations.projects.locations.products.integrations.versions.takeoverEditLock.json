  "description": "Clears the `locked_by` and `locked_at_timestamp`in the DRAFT version of this integration. It then performs the same action as the CreateDraftIntegrationVersion (i.e., copies the DRAFT version of the integration as a SNAPSHOT and then creates a new DRAFT version with the `locked_by` set to the `user_taking_over` and the `locked_at_timestamp` set to the current timestamp). Both the `locked_by` and `user_taking_over` are notified via email about the takeover. This RPC throws an exception if the integration is not in DRAFT status or if the `locked_by` and `locked_at_timestamp` fields are not set.The TakeoverEdit lock is treated the same as an edit of the integration, and hence shares ACLs with edit. Audit fields updated include last_modified_timestamp, last_modified_by.",
