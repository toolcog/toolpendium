The default value is the approximate time of the API request. An API report has three basic time concepts: - *Date of the API's request for a report*: When the API created and retrieved the report. - *Report's start time*: The beginning of the timespan shown in the report. The `startTime` must be before the `endTime` (if specified) and the current time when the request is made, or the API returns an error. - *Report's end time*: The end of the timespan shown in the report. For example, the timespan of events summarized in a report can start in April and end in May. The report itself can be requested in August. If the `endTime` is not specified, the report returns all activities from the `startTime` until the current time or the most recent 180 days if the `startTime` is more than 180 days in the past."

When an administrator changes a Calendar setting, the API reports this activity in the Calendar Settings `type` and `eventName` parameters.

Event parameters are in the form `{parameter1 name}{relational operator}{parameter1 value},{parameter2 name}{relational operator}{parameter2 value},...` These event parameters are associated with a specific `eventName`. An empty report is returned if the request's parameter doesn't belong to the `eventName`. For more information about the available `eventName` fields for each application and their associated parameters, go to the [ApplicationName](#applicationname) table, then click through to the Activity Events page in the Appendix for the application you want. In the following Drive activity examples, the returned list consists of all `edit` events where the `doc_id` parameter value matches the conditions defined by the relational operator. In the first example, the request returns all edited documents with a `doc_id` value equal to `12345`. In the second example, the report returns any edited documents where the `doc_id` value is not equal to `98765`. The `<>` operator is URL-encoded in the request's query string (`%3C%3E`): ``` GET...&eventName=edit&filters=doc_id==12345 GET...&eventName=edit&filters=doc_id%3C%3E98765 ``` A `filters` query supports these relational operators: * `==`—'equal to'. * `<>`—'not equal to'. Must be URL-encoded (%3C%3E). * `<`—'less than'. Must be URL-encoded (%3C). * `<=`—'less than or equal to'. Must be URL-encoded (%3C=). * `>`—'greater than'. Must be URL-encoded (%3E). * `>=`—'greater than or equal to'. Must be URL-encoded (%3E=). **Note:** The API doesn't accept multiple values of the same parameter. If a parameter is supplied more than once in the API request, the API only accepts the last value of that parameter. In addition, if an invalid parameter is supplied in the API request, the API ignores that parameter and returns the response corresponding to the remaining valid parameters. If no parameters are requested, all parameters are returned."
