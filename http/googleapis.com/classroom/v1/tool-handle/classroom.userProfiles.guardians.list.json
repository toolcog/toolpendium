To list guardians for any student that the requesting user may view guardians for, use the literal character `-` for the student ID. This method returns the following error codes: * `PERMISSION_DENIED` if a `student_id` is specified, and the requesting user is not permitted to view guardian information for that student, if `\"-\"` is specified as the `student_id` and the user is not a domain administrator, if guardians are not enabled for the domain in question, if the `invited_email_address` filter is set by a user who is not a domain administrator, or for other access errors. * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if a `student_id` is specified, but its format cannot be recognized (it is not an email address, nor a `student_id` from the API, nor the literal string `me`). May also be returned if an invalid `page_token` is provided. * `NOT_FOUND` if a `student_id` is specified, and its format can be recognized, but Classroom has no record of that student.",
