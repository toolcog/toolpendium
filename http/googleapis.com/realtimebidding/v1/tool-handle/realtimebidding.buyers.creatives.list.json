The ID of the child seat buyer under a bidder account. So for listing creatives pertaining to the child seat buyer (`456`) under bidder account (`123`), you would use the pattern: `buyers/456`. 3. The ID of the bidder itself. So for listing creatives pertaining to bidder (`123`), you would use `buyers/123`. If you want to access all creatives pertaining to both the bidder and all of its child seat accounts, you would use `bidders/{bidderAccountId}`, for example, for all creatives pertaining to bidder (`123`), use `bidders/123`."
