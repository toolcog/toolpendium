The possible values are: USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS Requires the origin to set valid caching headers to cache content. Responses without these headers will not be cached at Google's edge, and will require a full trip to the origin on every request, potentially impacting performance and increasing load on the origin server. FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all content, ignoring any \"private\", \"no-store\" or \"no-cache\" directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable) content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including common image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as uncacheable, as well as dynamic content (including HTML), will not be cached.",

With FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the lesser of client_ttl and default_ttl is used for the response max-age directive, along with a \"public\" directive. For cacheable content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the max-age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the response max-age directive to the lesser of the client_ttl and default_ttl, and also ensures a \"public\" cache-control directive is present. If a client TTL is not specified, a default value (1 hour) will be used. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year).",

Setting a TTL of \"0\" means \"always revalidate\". The value of defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL, but can be equal. When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL will overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.",

When the cache mode is set to CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to responses with the specified response code that lack any Cache-Control, Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When the cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to all responses with the specified response code, and override any caching headers. By default, Cloud CDN will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes: HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected Request), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s.

Omitting the policy and leaving negative_caching enabled will use Cloud CDN's default cache TTLs. Note that when specifying an explicit negative_caching_policy, you should take care to specify a cache TTL for all response codes that you wish to cache. Cloud CDN will not apply any default negative caching when a policy exists.",

This setting defines the default \"max-stale\" duration for any cached responses that do not specify a max-stale directive. Stale responses that exceed the TTL configured here will not be served. The default limit (max-stale) is 86400s (1 day), which will allow stale content to be served up to this limit beyond the max-age (or s-max-age) of a cached response.
