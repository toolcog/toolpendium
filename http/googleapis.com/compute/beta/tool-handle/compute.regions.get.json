This practice is especially recommended for unused quota information (the `quotas` field). To exclude one or more fields, set your request's `fields` query parameter to only include the fields you need. For example, to only include the `id` and `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to your request.",
