Google Compute Engine has two Target HTTP Proxy resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/alpha/targetHttpProxies) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/alpha/regionTargetHttpProxies) A target HTTP proxy is a component of Google Cloud HTTP load balancers. * targetHttpProxies are used by global external Application Load Balancers, classic Application Load Balancers, cross-region internal Application Load Balancers, and Traffic Director. * regionTargetHttpProxies are used by regional internal Application Load Balancers and regional external Application Load Balancers. Forwarding rules reference a target HTTP proxy, and the target proxy then references a URL map. For more information, read Using Target Proxies and Forwarding rule concepts.",

This field will be ignored when inserting a TargetHttpProxy. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in order to patch/update the TargetHttpProxy; otherwise, the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve the TargetHttpProxy.",

For example, https://networkservices.googleapis.com/v1alpha1/projects/project/locations/ locationhttpFilters/httpFilter Only filters that handle outbound connection and stream events may be specified. These filters work in conjunction with a default set of HTTP filters that may already be configured by Traffic Director. Traffic Director will determine the final location of these filters within xDS configuration based on the name of the HTTP filter. If Traffic Director positions multiple filters at the same location, those filters will be in the same order as specified in this list. httpFilters only applies for loadbalancers with loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. See ForwardingRule for more details.",

For global external Application Load Balancers, the minimum allowed value is 5 seconds and the maximum allowed value is 1200 seconds.

Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.",

When this field is set to true, Envoy proxies set up inbound traffic interception and bind to the IP address and port specified in the forwarding rule. This is generally useful when using Traffic Director to configure Envoy as a gateway or middle proxy (in other words, not a sidecar proxy). The Envoy proxy listens for inbound requests and handles requests when it receives them. The default is false.",
