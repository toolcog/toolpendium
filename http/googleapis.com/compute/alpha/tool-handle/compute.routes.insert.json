Google Compute Engine has three Operation resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/alpha/globalOperations) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/alpha/regionOperations) * [Zonal](/compute/docs/reference/rest/alpha/zoneOperations) You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous API requests. For more information, read Handling API responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal. - For global operations, use the `globalOperations` resource. - For regional operations, use the `regionOperations` resource. - For zonal operations, use the `zoneOperations` resource. For more information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources. Note that completed Operation resources have a limited retention period.",
