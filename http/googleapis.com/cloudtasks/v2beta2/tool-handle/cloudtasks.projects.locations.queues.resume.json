After a task has lived for `task_ttl`, the task will be deleted regardless of whether it was dispatched or not. The `task_ttl` for queues created via queue.yaml/xml is equal to the maximum duration because there is a [storage quota](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/quotas#Task_Queue) for these queues.

For more information about task de-duplication, see the documentation for CreateTaskRequest. Queues created by Cloud Tasks have a default `tombstone_ttl` of 1 hour."
