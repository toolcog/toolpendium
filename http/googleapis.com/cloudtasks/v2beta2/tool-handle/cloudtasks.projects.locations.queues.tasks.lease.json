The worker must acknowledge the task via AcknowledgeTask after they have performed the work associated with the task. The payload is intended to store data that the worker needs to perform the work associated with the task. To return the payloads in the response, set response_view to FULL. A maximum of 10 qps of LeaseTasks requests are allowed per queue. RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED is returned when this limit is exceeded.
