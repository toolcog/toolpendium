  "description": "Creates an API product in an organization. You create API products after you have proxied backend services using API proxies. An API product is a collection of API resources combined with quota settings and metadata that you can use to deliver customized and productized API bundles to your developer community. This metadata can include: - Scope - Environments - API proxies - Extensible profile API products enable you repackage APIs on the fly, without having to do any additional coding or configuration. Apigee recommends that you start with a simple API product including only required elements. You then provision credentials to apps to enable them to start testing your APIs. After you have authentication and authorization working against a simple API product, you can iterate to create finer-grained API products, defining different sets of API resources for each API product. **WARNING:** - If you don't specify an API proxy in the request body, *any* app associated with the product can make calls to *any* API in your entire organization. - If you don't specify an environment in the request body, the product allows access to all environments.

            "**apiResources**: Comma-separated list of API resources to be bundled in the API product. By default, the resource paths are mapped from the `proxy.pathsuffix` variable. The proxy path suffix is defined as the URI fragment following the ProxyEndpoint base path. For example, if the `apiResources` element is defined to be `/forecastrss` and the base path defined for the API proxy is `/weather`, then only requests to `/weather/forecastrss` are permitted by the API product. You can select a specific path, or you can select all subpaths with the following wildcard: - `/**`: Indicates that all sub-URIs are included. - `/*` : Indicates that only URIs one level down are included. By default, / supports the same resources as /** as well as the base path defined by the API proxy. For example, if the base path of the API proxy is `/v1/weatherapikey`, then the API product supports requests to `/v1/weatherapikey` and to any sub-URIs, such as `/v1/weatherapikey/forecastrss`, `/v1/weatherapikey/region/CA`, and so on. For more information, see Managing API products.",
            "**approvalType**: Flag that specifies how API keys are approved to access the APIs defined by the API product. If set to `manual`, the consumer key is generated and returned in \"pending\" state. In this case, the API keys won't work until they have been explicitly approved. If set to `auto`, the consumer key is generated and returned in \"approved\" state and can be used immediately. **Note:** Typically, `auto` is used to provide access to free or trial API products that provide limited quota or capabilities.",
            "**attributes**: Array of attributes that may be used to extend the default API product profile with customer-specific metadata. You can specify a maximum of 18 attributes. Use this property to specify the access level of the API product as either `public`, `private`, or `internal`. Only products marked `public` are available to developers in the Apigee developer portal. For example, you can set a product to `internal` while it is in development and then change access to `public` when it is ready to release on the portal. API products marked as `private` do not appear on the portal, but can be accessed by external developers.",
            "**createdAt**: Response only. Creation time of this environment as milliseconds since epoch.",

            "**environments**: Comma-separated list of environment names to which the API product is bound. Requests to environments that are not listed are rejected. By specifying one or more environments, you can bind the resources listed in the API product to a specific environment, preventing developers from accessing those resources through API proxies deployed in another environment. This setting is used, for example, to prevent resources associated with API proxies in `prod` from being accessed by API proxies deployed in `test`.",

Apigee rejects requests to API proxies that are not listed. **Note:** The API proxy names must already exist in the specified environment as they will be validated upon creation.",

            "**quotaCounterScope**: Scope of the quota decides how the quota counter gets applied and evaluate for quota violation. If the Scope is set as PROXY, then all the operations defined for the APIproduct that are associated with the same proxy will share the same quota counter set at the APIproduct level, making it a global counter at a proxy level. If the Scope is set as OPERATION, then each operations get the counter set at the API product dedicated, making it a local counter. Note that, the QuotaCounterScope applies only when an operation does not have dedicated quota set for itself.",
