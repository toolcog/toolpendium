This is likely to be a rare use case; it is only needed when the intended effect of undeploying this proxy is to cause the traffic it currently handles to be rerouted to some other existing proxy in the environment group. The GenerateUndeployChangeReport API may be used to examine routing changes before issuing the undeployment request, and its response will indicate if a sequenced rollout is recommended for the undeployment."
