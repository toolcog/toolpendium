  "description": "Creates and returns a new ReferenceImage resource. The `bounding_poly` field is optional. If `bounding_poly` is not specified, the system will try to detect regions of interest in the image that are compatible with the product_category on the parent product. If it is specified, detection is ALWAYS skipped. The system converts polygons into non-rotated rectangles. Note that the pipeline will resize the image if the image resolution is too large to process (above 50MP). Possible errors: * Returns INVALID_ARGUMENT if the image_uri is missing or longer than 4096 characters. * Returns INVALID_ARGUMENT if the product does not exist. * Returns INVALID_ARGUMENT if bounding_poly is not provided, and nothing compatible with the parent product's product_category is detected. * Returns INVALID_ARGUMENT if bounding_poly contains more than 10 polygons.",
