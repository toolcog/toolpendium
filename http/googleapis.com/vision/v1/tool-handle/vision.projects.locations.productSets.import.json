In each line, there are 8 columns. 1. image-uri 2. image-id 3. product-set-id 4. product-id 5. product-category 6. product-display-name 7. labels 8. bounding-poly The `image-uri`, `product-set-id`, `product-id`, and `product-category` columns are required. All other columns are optional. If the `ProductSet` or `Product` specified by the `product-set-id` and `product-id` values does not exist, then the system will create a new `ProductSet` or `Product` for the image. In this case, the `product-display-name` column refers to display_name, the `product-category` column refers to product_category, and the `labels` column refers to product_labels. The `image-id` column is optional but must be unique if provided. If it is empty, the system will automatically assign a unique id to the image. The `product-display-name` column is optional. If it is empty, the system sets the display_name field for the product to a space (\" \"). You can update the `display_name` later by using the API. If a `Product` with the specified `product-id` already exists, then the system ignores the `product-display-name`, `product-category`, and `labels` columns. The `labels` column (optional) is a line containing a list of comma-separated key-value pairs, in the following format: \"key_1=value_1,key_2=value_2,...,key_n=value_n\" The `bounding-poly` column (optional) identifies one region of interest from the image in the same manner as `CreateReferenceImage`. If you do not specify the `bounding-poly` column, then the system will try to detect regions of interest automatically. At most one `bounding-poly` column is allowed per line. If the image contains multiple regions of interest, add a line to the CSV file that includes the same product information, and the `bounding-poly` values for each region of interest. The `bounding-poly` column must contain an even number of comma-separated numbers, in the format \"p1_x,p1_y,p2_x,p2_y,...,pn_x,pn_y\". Use non-negative integers for absolute bounding polygons, and float values in [0, 1] for normalized bounding polygons. The system will resize the image if the image resolution is too large to process (larger than 20MP).",
