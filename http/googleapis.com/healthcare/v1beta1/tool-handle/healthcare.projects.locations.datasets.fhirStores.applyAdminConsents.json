  "description": "Applies the admin Consent resources for the FHIR store and reindexes the underlying resources in the FHIR store according to the aggregate consents. This method also updates the `consent_config.enforced_admin_consents` field of the FhirStore unless `validate_only=true` in ApplyAdminConsentsRequest. Any admin Consent resource change after this operation execution (including deletion) requires you to call ApplyAdminConsents again for the change to take effect. This method returns an Operation that can be used to track the progress of the resources that were reindexed, by calling GetOperation. Upon completion, the ApplyAdminConsentsResponse additionally contains the number of resources that were reindexed. If at least one Consent resource contains an error or fails be be enforced for any reason, the method returns an error instead of an Operation. No resources will be reindexed and the `consent_config.enforced_admin_consents` field will be unchanged. To enforce a consent check for data access, `consent_config.access_enforced` must be set to true for the FhirStore.",
