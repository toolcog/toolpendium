  "description": "Deletes FHIR resources that match a search query. Implements the FHIR standard conditional delete interaction ([DSTU2](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#2.1.0.12.1), [STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#2.21.0.13.1), [R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#3.1.0.7.1)). If multiple resources match, all matching resources are deleted. Search terms are provided as query parameters following the same pattern as the search method. Not all FHIR resources that match the search query might be deleted because, by default, a maximum of 100 FHIR resources can be deleted. The number of FHIR resources that can be deleted depends on the page size of the returned resources, which you can control using the `_count` query parameter. Even when using `_count`, you can delete a maximum 1,000 FHIR resources per each call of `conditionalDelete`. Note: Unless resource versioning is disabled by setting the disable_resource_versioning flag on the FHIR store, the deleted resources are moved to a history repository that can still be retrieved through vread and related methods, unless they are removed by the purge method. This method requires the`healthcare.fhirStores.searchResources` and `healthcare.fhirResources.delete` permissions on the parent FHIR store. For samples that show how to call `conditionalDelete`, see [Conditionally deleting a FHIR resource](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-resources#conditionally_deleting_a_fhir_resource).",
