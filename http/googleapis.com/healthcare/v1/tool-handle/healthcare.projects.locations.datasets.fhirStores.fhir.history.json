  "description": "Lists all the versions of a resource (including the current version and deleted versions) from the FHIR store. Implements the per-resource form of the FHIR standard history interaction ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#history), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#history), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#history)). On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of a `Bundle` resource of type `history`, containing the version history sorted from most recent to oldest versions. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. For samples that show how to call `history`, see [Listing FHIR resource versions](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-resources#listing_fhir_resource_versions).",
