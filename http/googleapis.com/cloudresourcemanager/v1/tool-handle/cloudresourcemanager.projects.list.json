  "description": "Lists Projects that the caller has the `resourcemanager.projects.get` permission on and satisfy the specified filter. This method returns Projects in an unspecified order. This method is eventually consistent with project mutations; this means that a newly created project may not appear in the results or recent updates to an existing project may not be reflected in the results. To retrieve the latest state of a project, use the GetProject method. NOTE: If the request filter contains a `parent.type` and `parent.id` and the caller has the `resourcemanager.projects.list` permission on the parent, the results will be drawn from an alternate index which provides more consistent results. In future versions of this API, this List method will be split into List and Search to properly capture the behavioral difference.",

        "description": "Optional. An expression for filtering the results of the request. Filter rules are case insensitive. If multiple fields are included in a filter query, the query will return results that match any of the fields. Some eligible fields for filtering are: + `name` + `id` + `labels.` (where *key* is the name of a label) + `parent.type` + `parent.id` + `lifecycleState` Some examples of filter queries: | Query | Description | |------------------|-----------------------------------------------------| | name:how* | The project's name starts with \"how\". | | name:Howl | The project's name is `Howl` or `howl`. | | name:HOWL | Equivalent to above. | | NAME:howl | Equivalent to above. | | labels.color:* | The project has the label `color`. | | labels.color:red | The project's label `color` has the value `red`. | | labels.color:red labels.size:big | The project's label `color` has the value `red` or its label `size` has the value `big`. | | lifecycleState:DELETE_REQUESTED | Only show projects that are pending deletion.| If no filter is specified, the call will return projects for which the user has the `resourcemanager.projects.get` permission. NOTE: To perform a by-parent query (eg., what projects are directly in a Folder), the caller must have the `resourcemanager.projects.list` permission on the parent and the filter must contain both a `parent.type` and a `parent.id` restriction (example: \"parent.type:folder parent.id:123\"). In this case an alternate search index is used which provides more consistent results."
