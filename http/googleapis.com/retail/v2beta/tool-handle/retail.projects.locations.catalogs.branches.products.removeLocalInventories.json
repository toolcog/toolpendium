  "description": "Remove local inventory information for a Product at a list of places at a removal timestamp. This process is asynchronous. If the request is valid, the removal will be enqueued and processed downstream. As a consequence, when a response is returned, removals are not immediately manifested in the Product queried by ProductService.GetProduct or ProductService.ListProducts. Local inventory information can only be removed using this method. ProductService.CreateProduct and ProductService.UpdateProduct has no effect on local inventories. The returned Operations will be obsolete after 1 day, and GetOperation API will return NOT_FOUND afterwards. If conflicting updates are issued, the Operations associated with the stale updates will not be marked as done until being obsolete.",
