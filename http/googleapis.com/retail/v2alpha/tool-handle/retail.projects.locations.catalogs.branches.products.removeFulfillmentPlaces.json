  "description": "We recommend that you use the ProductService.RemoveLocalInventories method instead of the ProductService.RemoveFulfillmentPlaces method. ProductService.RemoveLocalInventories achieves the same results but provides more fine-grained control over ingesting local inventory data. Incrementally removes place IDs from a Product.fulfillment_info.place_ids. This process is asynchronous and does not require the Product to exist before updating fulfillment information. If the request is valid, the update will be enqueued and processed downstream. As a consequence, when a response is returned, the removed place IDs are not immediately manifested in the Product queried by ProductService.GetProduct or ProductService.ListProducts. The returned Operations will be obsolete after 1 day, and GetOperation API will return NOT_FOUND afterwards. If conflicting updates are issued, the Operations associated with the stale updates will not be marked as done until being obsolete.",
