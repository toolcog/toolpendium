  "description": "Creates a custom \"from\" send-as alias. If an SMTP MSA is specified, Gmail will attempt to connect to the SMTP service to validate the configuration before creating the alias. If ownership verification is required for the alias, a message will be sent to the email address and the resource's verification status will be set to `pending`; otherwise, the resource will be created with verification status set to `accepted`. If a signature is provided, Gmail will sanitize the HTML before saving it with the alias. This method is only available to service account clients that have been delegated domain-wide authority.",
