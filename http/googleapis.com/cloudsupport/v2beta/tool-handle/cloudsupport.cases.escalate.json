Organizations are identified by a number, so the name of a case parented by an organization would look like this: ``` organizations/123/cases/456 ``` Projects have two unique identifiers, an ID and a number, and they look like this: ``` projects/abc/cases/456 ``` ``` projects/123/cases/456 ``` You can use either of them when calling the API.
