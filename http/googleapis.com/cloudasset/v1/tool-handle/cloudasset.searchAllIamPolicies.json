If not specified or empty, it will search all the IAM policies within the specified `scope`. Note that the query string is compared against each IAM policy binding, including its principals, roles, and IAM conditions. The returned IAM policies will only contain the bindings that match your query. To learn more about the IAM policy structure, see the [IAM policy documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/allow-policies/structure). Examples: * `policy:amy@gmail.com` to find IAM policy bindings that specify user \"amy@gmail.com\". * `policy:roles/compute.admin` to find IAM policy bindings that specify the Compute Admin role. * `policy:comp*` to find IAM policy bindings that contain \"comp\" as a prefix of any word in the binding. * `policy.role.permissions:storage.buckets.update` to find IAM policy bindings that specify a role containing \"storage.buckets.update\" permission. Note that if callers don't have `iam.roles.get` access to a role's included permissions, policy bindings that specify this role will be dropped from the search results. * `policy.role.permissions:upd*` to find IAM policy bindings that specify a role containing \"upd\" as a prefix of any word in the role permission. Note that if callers don't have `iam.roles.get` access to a role's included permissions, policy bindings that specify this role will be dropped from the search results. * `resource:organizations/123456` to find IAM policy bindings that are set on \"organizations/123456\". * `resource=//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/myproject` to find IAM policy bindings that are set on the project named \"myproject\". * `Important` to find IAM policy bindings that contain \"Important\" as a word in any of the searchable fields (except for the included permissions). * `resource:(instance1 OR instance2) policy:amy` to find IAM policy bindings that are set on resources \"instance1\" or \"instance2\" and also specify user \"amy\". * `roles:roles/compute.admin` to find IAM policy bindings that specify the Compute Admin role. * `memberTypes:user` to find IAM policy bindings that contain the principal type \"user\"."
