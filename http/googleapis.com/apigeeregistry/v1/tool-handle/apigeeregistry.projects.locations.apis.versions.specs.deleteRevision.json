        "Describes a version of an API in a structured way. ApiSpecs provide formal descriptions that consumers can use to use a version. ApiSpec resources are intended to be fully-resolved descriptions of an ApiVersion. When specs consist of multiple files, these should be bundled together (e.g., in a zip archive) and stored as a unit. Multiple specs can exist to provide representations in different API description formats. Synchronization of these representations would be provided by tooling and background services.",

Label keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are allowed. No more than 64 user labels can be associated with one resource (System labels are excluded). See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples of labels.
