This id is used to identify the set of models that will be used to make the prediction. We currently support three placements with the following IDs by default: // * `shopping_cart`: Predicts items frequently bought together with one or more catalog items in the same shopping session. Commonly displayed after `add-to-cart` event, on product detail pages, or on the shopping cart page. * `home_page`: Predicts the next product that a user will most likely engage with or purchase based on the shopping or viewing history of the specified `userId` or `visitorId`. For example - Recommendations for you. * `product_detail`: Predicts the next product that a user will most likely engage with or purchase. The prediction is based on the shopping or viewing history of the specified `userId` or `visitorId` and its relevance to a specified `CatalogItem`. Typically used on product detail pages. For example - More items like this. * `recently_viewed_default`: Returns up to 75 items recently viewed by the specified `userId` or `visitorId`, most recent ones first. Returns nothing if neither of them has viewed any items yet. For example - Recently viewed.
