  "description": "Retrieves an audience export of users. After creating an audience, the users are not immediately available for exporting. First, a request to `CreateAudienceExport` is necessary to create an audience export of users, and then second, this method is used to retrieve the users in the audience export. See [Creating an Audience Export](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/audience-list-basics) for an introduction to Audience Exports with examples. Audiences in Google Analytics 4 allow you to segment your users in the ways that are important to your business. To learn more, see https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9267572. Audience Export APIs have some methods at alpha and other methods at beta stability. The intention is to advance methods to beta stability after some feedback and adoption. To give your feedback on this API, complete the [Google Analytics Audience Export API Feedback](https://forms.gle/EeA5u5LW6PEggtCEA) form.",
