  "description": " Inserts a new file. This method supports an */upload* URI and accepts uploaded media with the following characteristics: - *Maximum file size:* 5,120 GB - *Accepted Media MIME types:*`*/*` Note: Specify a valid MIME type, rather than the literal `*/*` value. The literal `*/*` is only used to indicate that any valid MIME type can be uploaded. For more information on uploading files, see [Upload file data](/drive/api/guides/manage-uploads). Apps creating shortcuts with `files.insert` must specify the MIME type `application/vnd.google-apps.shortcut`. Apps should specify a file extension in the `title` property when inserting files with the API. For example, an operation to insert a JPEG file should specify something like `\"title\": \"cat.jpg\"` in the metadata. Subsequent `GET` requests include the read-only `fileExtension` property populated with the extension originally specified in the `title` property. When a Google Drive user requests to download a file, or when the file is downloaded through the sync client, Drive builds a full filename (with extension) based on the title. In cases where the extension is missing, Drive attempts to determine the extension based on the file's MIME type.",
