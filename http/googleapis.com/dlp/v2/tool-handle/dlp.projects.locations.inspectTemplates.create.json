Additionally, the characters surrounding any match must be of a different type than the adjacent characters within the word, so letters must be next to non-letters and digits next to non-digits. For example, the dictionary word \"jen\" will match the first three letters of the text \"jen123\" but will return no matches for \"jennifer\".
