Queries using this reservation might use more slots during runtime if ignore_idle_slots is set to false. If the new reservation's slot capacity exceeds the project's slot capacity or if total slot capacity of the new reservation and its siblings exceeds the project's slot capacity, the request will fail with `google.rpc.Code.RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`.
