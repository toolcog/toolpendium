Of which `:` means `HAS`, and is roughly the same as `=` * `` must be the same data type as field * `` can be `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` Examples of valid filters: * `annotations.owner` returns endpoints that have a annotation with the key `owner`, this is the same as `annotations:owner` * `annotations.protocol=gRPC` returns endpoints that have key/value `protocol=gRPC` * `address=192.108.1.105` returns endpoints that have this address * `port>8080` returns endpoints that have port number larger than 8080 * `name>projects/my-project/locations/us-east1/namespaces/my-namespace/services/my-service/endpoints/endpoint-c` returns endpoints that have name that is alphabetically later than the string, so \"endpoint-e\" is returned but \"endpoint-a\" is not * `name=projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/namespaces/my-namespace/services/my-service/endpoints/ep-1` returns the endpoint that has an endpoint_id equal to `ep-1` * `annotations.owner!=sd AND annotations.foo=bar` returns endpoints that have `owner` in annotation key but value is not `sd` AND have key/value `foo=bar` * `doesnotexist.foo=bar` returns an empty list. Note that endpoint doesn't have a field called \"doesnotexist\".
