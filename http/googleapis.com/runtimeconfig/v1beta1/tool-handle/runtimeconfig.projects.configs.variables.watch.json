  "description": "Watches a specific variable and waits for a change in the variable's value. When there is a change, this method returns the new value or times out. If a variable is deleted while being watched, the `variableState` state is set to `DELETED` and the method returns the last known variable `value`. If you set the deadline for watching to a larger value than internal timeout (60 seconds), the current variable value is returned and the `variableState` will be `VARIABLE_STATE_UNSPECIFIED`.
