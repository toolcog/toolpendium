            "**authority**: Output only. The user who authorized the creation of the subscription. Format: `users/{user}` For Google Workspace users, the `{user}` value is the [`user.id`](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/users#User.FIELDS.ids) field from the Directory API.",
            "**createTime**: Output only. The time when the subscription is created.",

            "**eventTypes**: Required. Immutable. Unordered list. Input for creating a subscription. Otherwise, output only. One or more types of events to receive about the target resource. Formatted according to the CloudEvents specification. The supported event types depend on the target resource of your subscription. For details, see [Supported Google Workspace events](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides#supported-events). By default, you also receive events about the [lifecycle of your subscription](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides/events-lifecycle). You don't need to specify lifecycle events for this field. If you specify an event type that doesn't exist for the target resource, the request returns an HTTP `400 Bad Request` status code.",

Format: `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}` You must create the topic in the same Google Cloud project where you create this subscription. When the topic receives events, the events are encoded as Cloud Pub/Sub messages. For details, see the [Google Cloud Pub/Sub Protocol Binding for CloudEvents](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloudevents/blob/main/docs/spec/pubsub.md)."

If you specify a field that doesn't exist for the resource, the system ignores the field.",

For example, for an event where a Google Chat message was created, whether the payload contains data about the [`Message`](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces.messages) resource. If false, the event payload only includes the name of the changed resource."

            "**targetResource**: Required. Immutable. The Google Workspace resource that's monitored for events, formatted as the [full resource name](https://google.aip.dev/122#full-resource-names). To learn about target resources and the events that they support, see [Supported Google Workspace events](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events#supported-events). A user can only authorize your app to create one subscription for a given target resource. If your app tries to create another subscription with the same user credentials, the request returns an `ALREADY_EXISTS` error.",
