  "description": "Returns a signed URL for uploading a function source code. For more information about the signed URL usage see: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls. Once the function source code upload is complete, the used signed URL should be provided in CreateFunction or UpdateFunction request as a reference to the function source code. When uploading source code to the generated signed URL, please follow these restrictions: * Source file type should be a zip file. * No credentials should be attached - the signed URLs provide access to the target bucket using internal service identity; if credentials were attached, the identity from the credentials would be used, but that identity does not have permissions to upload files to the URL. When making a HTTP PUT request, specify this header: * `content-type: application/zip` Do not specify this header: * `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`",
