  "description": "Once we integrate all evidence connecting a target to a specific disease, we\n compute an association score by the means of an harmonic sum. This *association score* provides\n an indication of how strong the evidence behind each connection is and can be\n used to rank genes in order of likelihood as drug targets.\n The association ID is constructed by using the Ensembl ID of the gene and the\n EFO ID for the disease (e.g. ENSG00000073756-EFO_0003767).\n The method returns an association object, which contains the data and summary\n on each evidence type included in the calculation of the score, as well as the score itself.\n",
