  "description": "We call **evidence** a unit of data that support a connection between a target and a disease.\nThe Open Targets Platform integrates multiple types of evidence including genetic associations,\nsomatic mutations, RNA expression and target-disease associations mined from the literature.\nThis method allows you to retrieve a single evidence item or a list of pieces of evidence by using their\ntargetvalidation.org ID.\n\nEvidence IDs are unique within each data release (e.g. `8ed3d7568a8c6cac9c95cfb869bac762` for release 1.2).\nYou can obtain a list of evidence and their IDs from other API calls such as [/public/evidence/filter](#!/public/get_public_evidence_filter).\n\n**Please note** that a specific evidence ID may change between data releases. We can not guarantee that a specific evidence ID will refer to the same piece of evidence connecting a target and its diseases.\n",
