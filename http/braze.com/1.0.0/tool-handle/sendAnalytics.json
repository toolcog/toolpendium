  "description": "This endpoint allows you to retrieve a daily series of various stats for a tracked `send_id`. Braze stores send analytics for 14 days after the send.\n\nCampaign conversions will be attributed towards the most recent send id that a given user has received from the campaign.\n\n> The `send_id` is only generated for API campaign sends targeting segments, connected audiences or broadcasts. When relevant, the `send_id` is included in response for the `messages/send`, `messages/schedule`, `campaign/trigger/send` and `campaign/trigger/schedule` endpoints.\n\n### Components Used\n- [Campaign Identifier](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/identifier_types/)\n\n### Send Analytics Endpoint API Response\n\n```json\nContent-Type: application/json\nAuthorization: Bearer YOUR-REST-API-KEY\n{\n            \"variation_name\": (string) variation name,\n            \"sent\": (int) the number of sends,\n            \"delivered\": (int) the number of messages successfully delivered,\n            \"undelivered\": (int) the number of undelivered,\n            \"delivery_failed\": (int) the number of rejected,\n            \"direct_opens\": (int) the number of direct opens,\n            \"total_opens\": (int) the number of total opens,\n            \"bounces\": (int) the number of bounces,\n            \"body_clicks\": (int) the number of body clicks,\n            \"revenue\": (float) the number of dollars of revenue (USD),\n            \"unique_recipients\": (int) the number of unique recipients,\n            \"conversions\": (int) the number of conversions,\n            \"conversions_by_send_time\": (int) the number of conversions,\n            \"conversions1\": (int, optional) the number of conversions for the second conversion event,\n            \"conversions1_by_send_time\": (int, optional) the number of conversions for the second conversion event by send time,\n            \"conversions2\": (int, optional) the number of conversions for the third conversion event,\n            \"conversions2_by_send_time\": (int, optional) the number of conversions for the third conversion event by send time,\n            \"conversions3\": (int, optional) the number of conversions for the fourth conversion event,\n            \"conversions3_by_send_time\": (int, optional) the number of conversions for the fourth conversion event by send time\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      \"conversions_by_send_time\": 0,\n      \"conversions1_by_send_time\": 0,\n      \"conversions2_by_send_time\": 0,\n      \"conversions3_by_send_time\": 0,\n      \"conversions\": 0,\n      \"conversions1\": 0,\n      \"conversions2\": 0,\n      \"conversions3\": 0,\n      \"unique_recipients\": 1,\n      \"revenue\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"message\": \"success\"\n}\n```",
