  "description": "Creates or updates an individual annotation for the specified report.\nAnnotations are individual findings that have been identified as part of a report, for example, a line of code that represents a vulnerability. These annotations can be attached to a specific file and even a specific line in that file, however, that is optional. Annotations are not mandatory and a report can contain up to 1000 annotations.\n\nJust as reports, annotation needs to be uploaded with a unique ID that can later be used to identify the report as an alternative to the generated [UUID](https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/meta/uri-uuid#uuid). If you want to use an existing id from your own system, we recommend prefixing it with your system's name to avoid collisions, for example, mySystem-annotation001.\n\n### Sample cURL request:\n```\ncurl --request PUT 'https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/<username>/<reposity-name>/commit/<commit-hash>/reports/mySystem-001/annotations/mysystem-annotation001' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data-raw '{\n    \"title\": \"Security scan report\",\n    \"annotation_type\": \"VULNERABILITY\",\n    \"summary\": \"This line represents a security thread.\",\n    \"severity\": \"HIGH\",\n    \"path\": \"my-service/src/main/java/com/myCompany/mysystem/logic/Main.java\",\n    \"line\": 42\n}'\n```\n\n### Possible field values:\nannotation_type: VULNERABILITY, CODE_SMELL, BUG\nresult: PASSED, FAILED, IGNORED, SKIPPED\nseverity: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, CRITICAL\n\nPlease refer to the [Code Insights documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/code-insights-994316785.html) for more information.\n",
