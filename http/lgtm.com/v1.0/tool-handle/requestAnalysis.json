  "description": "Trigger the analysis of a specific commit to a project. If a previous attempt to analyze that commit failed, this triggers a fresh analysis.  This is supported for all LGTM projects, regardless of repository type or host. The commit must be available in the main repository, but can be on a branch that isn't tracked by LGTM. For both LGTM.com and LGTM Enterprise, you must include an access token with the `analyses:write` scope.\n\nWhen you request the analysis of a commit, the API returns:\n- `operation-id`: used to track the status of the task using the `/operations` endpoint. For more information, see [Get operation status](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/api/api-v1#opIdgetOperation).\n- `status`: initially pending.\n- `task-result`: containing information about the progress and results of the analysis.\n",
