  "description": "Upload a database representing a snapshot of a codebase.  The database is sent in one or more parts. Each part is sent in the request body. \nUse the [`POST /snapshots/{project-id}/{language}`](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/api/api-v1#opIdinitSnapshotUpload) endpoint  to start an upload session before uploading a database part. Database parts must have been generated and prepared for upload using the CodeQL CLI or the QL command-line tools. For further information on exporting externally-built databases,  see [Preparing snapshots to upload to LGTM](https://help.semmle.com/wiki/display/SD/Preparing+snapshots+to+upload+to+LGTM).\n\nSplit large databases into multiple parts. Upload the parts by making a separate request for each part.  Don't upload the next part until you've successfully uploaded the previous part.\n\nIf the upload fails you should retry it with the same data.\n",
