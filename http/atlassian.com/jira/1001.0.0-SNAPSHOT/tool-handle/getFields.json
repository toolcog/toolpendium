That is, timetracking fields, subtasks, votes, and watches.\n *  For all other fields, this operation only returns the fields that the user has permission to view (that is, the field is used in at least one project that the user has *Browse Projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for.)\n\nThis operation can be accessed anonymously.\n\n**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** None.",
