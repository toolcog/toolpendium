  "description": "Sets a property value on multiple issues.\n\nThe value set can be a constant or determined by a [Jira expression](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/). Expressions must be computable with constant complexity when applied to a set of issues. Expressions must also comply with the [restrictions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/#restrictions) that apply to all Jira expressions.\n\nThe issues to be updated can be specified by a filter.\n\nThe filter identifies issues eligible for update using these criteria:\n\n *  `entityIds` Only issues from this list are eligible.\n *  `currentValue` Only issues with the property set to this value are eligible.\n *  `hasProperty`:\n    \n     *  If *true*, only issues with the property are eligible.\n     *  If *false*, only issues without the property are eligible.\n\nIf more than one criteria is specified, they are joined with the logical *AND*: only issues that satisfy all criteria are eligible.\n\nIf an invalid combination of criteria is provided, an error is returned. For example, specifying a `currentValue` and `hasProperty` as *false* would not match any issues (because without the property the property cannot have a value).\n\nThe filter is optional. Without the filter all the issues visible to the user and where the user has the EDIT\\_ISSUES permission for the issue are considered eligible.\n\nThis operation is:\n\n *  transactional, either all eligible issues are updated or, when errors occur, none are updated.\n *  [asynchronous](#async). Follow the `location` link in the response to determine the status of the task and use [Get task](#api-rest-api-3-task-taskId-get) to obtain subsequent updates.\n\n**[Permissions](#permissions) required:**\n\n *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for each project containing issues.\n *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.\n *  *Edit issues* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for each issue.",
