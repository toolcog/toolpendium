  "description": "Returns a summary information about all profiles linked to the requesting membership type/membership ID that have valid Destiny information. The passed-in Membership Type/Membership ID may be a Bungie.Net membership or a Destiny membership. It only returns the minimal amount of data to begin making more substantive requests, but will hopefully serve as a useful alternative to UserServices for people who just care about Destiny data. Note that it will only return linked accounts whose linkages you are allowed to view.",
