Usually this will be only a single Quest, but some quests have multiple available that you can choose from at any given time. All possible quests for a milestone can be found in the DestinyMilestoneDefinition, but they must be combined with this Live data to determine which one(s) are actually active right now. It is possible for Milestones to not have any quests.",

Think of these as \"overview/checklist\" rewards that may be provided for Milestones that may provide rewards for performing a variety of tasks that aren't under a specific Quest.",

A good example of this would be - if this existed in Destiny 1 - the number of wins you currently have on your Trials of Osiris ticket. Looking in the DestinyMilestoneDefinition, you can use the string identifier of this dictionary to look up more info about the value, including localized string content for displaying the value. The value in the dictionary is the floating point number. The definition will tell you how to format this number.",

I already regret this, even as I'm typing it. [I told you I'd regret this] You see, sometimes a milestone may be directly correlated with a set of vendors that provide varying tiers of rewards. The player may not be able to interact with one or more of those vendors. This will return the hashes of the Vendors that the player *can* interact with, allowing you to show their current inventory as rewards or related items to the Milestone or its activities.\r",
