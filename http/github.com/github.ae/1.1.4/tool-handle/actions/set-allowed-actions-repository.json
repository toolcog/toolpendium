For more information, see \"[Set GitHub Actions permissions for a repository](#set-github-actions-permissions-for-a-repository).\"\n\nIf the repository belongs to an organization or enterprise that has `selected` actions set at the organization or enterprise levels, then you cannot override any of the allowed actions settings.\n\nTo use the `patterns_allowed` setting for private repositories, the repository must belong to an enterprise. If the repository does not belong to an enterprise, then the `patterns_allowed` setting only applies to public repositories.\n\nYou must authenticate using an access token with the `repo` scope to use this endpoint.
