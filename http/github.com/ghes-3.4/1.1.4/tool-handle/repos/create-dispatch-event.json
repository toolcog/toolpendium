  "name": "repos_create-dispatch-event",
  "description": "You can use this endpoint to trigger a webhook event called `repository_dispatch` when you want activity that happens outside of GitHub Enterprise Server to trigger a GitHub Actions workflow or GitHub App webhook. You must configure your GitHub Actions workflow or GitHub App to run when the `repository_dispatch` event occurs. For an example `repository_dispatch` webhook payload, see \"[RepositoryDispatchEvent](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/webhooks/event-payloads/#repository_dispatch).\"\n\nThe `client_payload` parameter is available for any extra information that your workflow might need. This parameter is a JSON payload that will be passed on when the webhook event is dispatched. For example, the `client_payload` can include a message that a user would like to send using a GitHub Actions workflow. Or the `client_payload` can be used as a test to debug your workflow.\n\nThis endpoint requires write access to the repository by providing either:\n\n  - Personal access tokens with `repo` scope. For more information, see \"[Creating a personal access token for the command line](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)\" in the GitHub Help documentation.\n  - GitHub Apps with both `metadata:read` and `contents:read&write` permissions.\n\nThis input example shows how you can use the `client_payload` as a test to debug your workflow.",
