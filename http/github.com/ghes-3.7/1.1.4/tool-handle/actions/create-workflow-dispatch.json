  "description": "You can use this endpoint to manually trigger a GitHub Actions workflow run. You can replace `workflow_id` with the workflow file name. For example, you could use `main.yaml`.\n\nYou must configure your GitHub Actions workflow to run when the [`workflow_dispatch` webhook](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads#workflow_dispatch) event occurs. The `inputs` are configured in the workflow file. For more information about how to configure the `workflow_dispatch` event in the workflow file, see \"[Events that trigger workflows](/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch).\"\n\nYou must authenticate using an access token with the `repo` scope to use this endpoint. GitHub Apps must have the `actions:write` permission to use this endpoint. For more information, see \"[Creating a personal access token for the command line](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.7/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).\"",
