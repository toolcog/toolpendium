  "description": "**Deprecation Notice:** GitHub Enterprise Server will discontinue OAuth endpoints that contain `access_token` in the path parameter. We have introduced new endpoints that allow you to securely manage tokens for OAuth Apps by moving `access_token` to the request body. For more information, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-app-endpoint/).\n\nOAuth applications can use a special API method for checking OAuth token validity without exceeding the normal rate limits for failed login attempts. Authentication works differently with this particular endpoint. You must use [Basic Authentication](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.2/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#basic-authentication) when accessing this endpoint, using the OAuth application's `client_id` and `client_secret` as the username and password. Invalid tokens will return `404 NOT FOUND`.",
