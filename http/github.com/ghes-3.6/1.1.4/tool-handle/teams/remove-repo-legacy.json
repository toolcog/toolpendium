We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [Remove a repository from a team](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.6/rest/reference/teams#remove-a-repository-from-a-team) endpoint.\n\nIf the authenticated user is an organization owner or a team maintainer, they can remove any repositories from the team. To remove a repository from a team as an organization member, the authenticated user must have admin access to the repository and must be able to see the team.
