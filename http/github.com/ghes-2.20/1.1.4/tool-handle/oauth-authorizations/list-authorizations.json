The [OAuth Authorizations API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@2.20/rest/reference/oauth-authorizations) will be removed on November, 13, 2020. For more information, including scheduled brownouts, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-auth-endpoint/).",
