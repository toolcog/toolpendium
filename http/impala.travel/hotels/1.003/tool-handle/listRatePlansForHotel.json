  "name": "listRatePlansForHotel",
  "description": "Returns a list of all rate plans available for you for a hotel.\n\nRate plans are products the hotel is offering. They typically consist of a combination of restrictiveness in case of cancellations or changes, the time they're bookable, minimum or maximum length of stay restrictions (e.g. week-long bookings), included components like breakfast or dinner and/or the conditions under which the room can be sold (e.g. private rates that can only be offered and sold to a closed user group behind login).\n\nExamples of rate plans:\n\n* Non-refundable room rate that includes breakfast\n* Room-only rate with free cancellation up to 14 days before arrival\n\nFor each such rate plan this endpoint returns the room types it's available for, alongside prices for each date and occupancy that can be sold â€“ or the information that the room isn't available (closed) for a certain date.\n\nFor the vast majority of our customers, availability searches using the [List all hotels](https://docs.impala.travel/docs/booking-api/spec/openapi.seller.yaml/paths/~1hotels/get) endpoint are the best choice. It accepts the dates your guest is looking for and provides the rates to display.\n\nThis endpoint can help augment this for two additional use cases:\n\nThis endpoint allows you to query rate prices for all future dates in one go, making it a great choice to feed availability information and prices into your own system or displaying a rate calender to guide your guests to gain an overview of future availability and prices.",
