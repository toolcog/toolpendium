They typically consist of a combination of restrictiveness in case of cancellations or changes, the time they're bookable, minimum or maximum length of stay restrictions (e.g. week-long bookings), included components like breakfast or dinner and/or the conditions under which the room can be sold (e.g. private rates that can only be offered and sold to a closed user group behind login).\n\nExamples of rate plans:\n\n* Non-refundable room rate that includes breakfast\n* Room-only rate with free cancellation up to 14 days before arrival\n\nThis endpoint returns a singular available rate plan.",
