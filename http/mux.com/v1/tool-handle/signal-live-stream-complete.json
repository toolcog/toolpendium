  "description": "(Optional) End the live stream recording immediately instead of waiting for the reconnect_window. `EXT-X-ENDLIST` tag is added to the HLS manifest which notifies the player that this live stream is over.\n\nMux does not close the encoder connection immediately. Encoders are often configured to re-establish connections immediately which would result in a new recorded asset. For this reason, Mux waits for 60s before closing the connection with the encoder. This 60s timeframe is meant to give encoder operators a chance to disconnect from their end.\n",
