In this case, you can\ndirect Square to cancel the payment using this endpoint. In the request, you provide the same\nidempotency key that you provided in your `CreatePayment` request that you want to cancel. After\ncanceling the payment, you can submit your `CreatePayment` request again.\n\nNote that if no payment with the specified idempotency key is found, no action is taken and the endpoint\nreturns successfully.",
