These roles define the actions and permissions granted to an\nemployee with that role. For example, an employee with a \"Shift Manager\"\nrole might be able to issue refunds in Square Point of Sale, whereas an\nemployee with a \"Clerk\" role might not.\n\nRoles are assigned with the [V1UpdateEmployee](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-08-18/v1-employees-api/update-employee-role)\nendpoint. An employee can have only one role at a time.\n\nIf an employee has no role, they have none of the permissions associated\nwith roles. All employees can accept payments with Square Point of Sale.",
