Orders include all sales,\nreturns, and exchanges regardless of how or when they entered the Square\necosystem (such as Point of Sale, Invoices, and Connect APIs).\n\n`SearchOrders` requests need to specify which locations to search and define a\n[SearchOrdersQuery](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-08-18/objects/SearchOrdersQuery) object that controls\nhow to sort or filter the results. Your `SearchOrdersQuery` can:\n\n  Set filter criteria.\n  Set the sort order.\n  Determine whether to return results as complete `Order` objects or as\n[OrderEntry](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-08-18/objects/OrderEntry) objects.\n\nNote that details for orders processed with Square Point of Sale while in\noffline mode might not be transmitted to Square for up to 72 hours. Offline\norders have a `created_at` value that reflects the time the order was created,\nnot the time it was subsequently transmitted to Square.",
