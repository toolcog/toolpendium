  "description": "Provides comprehensive information for a single settlement.\n\nThe returned `Settlement` objects include an `entries` field that lists\nthe transactions that contribute to the settlement total. Most\nsettlement entries correspond to a payment payout, but settlement\nentries are also generated for less common events, like refunds, manual\nadjustments, or chargeback holds.\n\nSquare initiates its regular deposits as indicated in the\n[Deposit Options with Square](https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/3807)\nhelp article. Details for a regular deposit are usually not available\nfrom Connect API endpoints before 10 p.m. PST the same day.\n\nSquare does not know when an initiated settlement **completes**, only\nwhether it has failed. A completed settlement is typically reflected in\na bank account within 3 business days, but in exceptional cases it may\ntake longer.",
