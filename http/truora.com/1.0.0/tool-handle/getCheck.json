  "description": "Returns the results of the check that matches the ID provided, complete with a set of scores explained below.\n\n### Scores:\n\n\n- **Global Score**: Average risk associated with a person, company or vehicle, according to  the background check results. The global score considers results that are validated with the  ID number provided. The score ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents high risk and 1 low risk.\n\n\n- **ID Score**: Average risk associated with a person according to the background check  results. The ID score considers the results that are validated with a person identity  document. The score ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents high risk and 1 low risk. \n\n\n- **Homonym Score**: Average risk associated with a person according to the background check  results. The homonym score considers results that are validated against the name of a person and could not be validated with their ID number. These results might have homonyms associated with them. The score ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents high risk and 1 low risk.\n\n\nIn order to calculate these scores, a weighted average is considered with different weights allocated to each dataset. Scores can be customized using the config endpoints by assigning a weight to each dataset according to its relevance.\n\nKeep in mind that results from the API vary depending on the country, check type and the inputs entered on check creation.",
