At this time, only Linodes can be transferred.\n\nWhen accepted, email confirmations are sent to the accounts that created and accepted the transfer. A transfer\ncan take up to three hours to complete once accepted. Once a transfer is completed, billing for transferred\nservices ends for the sending account and begins for the receiving account.\n\nThis command can only be accessed by the unrestricted users of the account that receives the transfer. Users\nof the same account that created a transfer cannot accept the transfer.\n\nThere are several conditions that must be met in order to accept a transfer request:\n\n1. Only transfers with a `pending` status can be accepted.\n\n1.
