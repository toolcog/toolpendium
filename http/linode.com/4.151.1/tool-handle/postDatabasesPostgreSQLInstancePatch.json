  "description": "Apply security patches and updates to the underlying operating system of the Managed PostgreSQL Database. This function runs during regular maintenance windows, which are configurable with the **Managed PostgreSQL Database Update** ([PUT /databases/postgresql/instances/{instanceId}](/docs/api/databases/#managed-postgresql-database-update)) command.\n\nRequires `read_write` access to the Database.\n\nThe Database must have an `active` status to perform this command.\n\n**Note**\n\n* If your database cluster is configured with a single node, you will experience downtime during this maintenance. Consider upgrading to a high availability plan to avoid any downtime due to maintenance.\n\n* **The database software is not updated automatically.** To upgrade to a new database engine version, consider deploying a new Managed Database with your preferred version. You can then migrate your databases from the original Managed Database cluster to the new one.\n",
