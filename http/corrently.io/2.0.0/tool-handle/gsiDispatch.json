  "description": "Dispatch of green energy has two aspects to consider:\n  - Availability of gerneration facility (depends on weather and installed capacity)\n  - Demand of energy\nUsing the green power index (Gr√ºnstromIndex) we have received a tool to automate distribution of energy in order to prevent redispatch situations. Doing this alows to opimize resource usage (tactical) and leverage data for investment planning (strategic).\n",
