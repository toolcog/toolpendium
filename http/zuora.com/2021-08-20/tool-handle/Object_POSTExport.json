  "description": "Use this operation to create a data source export. After you have created a data source export, use [CRUD: Retrieve an export](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Object_GETExport) to check the status of the data source export and access the exported data.\n\n## Limits\n\nZuora system enforces the following limits on data source exports:\n\n* The maximum processing time per export is 3 hours. If an export is executed for longer than 3 hours, it will be killed automatically.\n* The maximum number of concurrent exports is 50 per tenant. Exports in `Pending` and `Processing` status are counted towards the concurrent export limit. Zuora system will reject the subsequent data source export requests once the concurrent export limit is reached.\n\nWhen you export data from Zuora, each exported file is available for download for 7 days. Data source exports (Export objects) older than 90 days are automatically deleted.\n\n**Note:** This operation supports the [Export ZOQL](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL) query language. However, this operation does not support some data sources, objects, and fields in Export ZOQL queries. For full compatibility with Export ZOQL, Zuora recommends that you use the [AQuA API](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/T_Aggregate_Query_API) instead of this operation.\n",
