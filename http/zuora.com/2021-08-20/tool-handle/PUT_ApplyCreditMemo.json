The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.

See [Billing Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles) for more information.\n\nWhen you apply a credit memo, the total number of credit memo items and the items that credit memo items to be applied to must be less than or equal to 10,000.\n\nIf the limit is hit, you can follow the following instructions:\n\n- If you want to apply one credit memo to multiple invoices or debit memos, decrease the number of invoices or debit memos in the request.\n- If you want to apply one credit memo to a single invoice or debit memo with a large volume of items, you have to specify invoice items or debit memo items in the request. The maximum number of invoice items or debit memo items that you can specify in the request is 1,000.\n- If a credit memo has a large volume of items, you have to specify credit memo items in the request. The maximum number of credit memo items that you can specify in the request is 1,000.\n        \nIf the Proration application rule is used, when applying credit memos, the following quantity must be less than or equal to 10,000: \n\n(number of invoice items + number of debit memo items) * number of credit memo items\n\nOtherwise, the First In First Out rule will be used instead of the Proration rule.\n",
