  "description": "Retrieve files such as export results, invoices, and accounting period reports.\n\nThe response content type depends on the type of file that you retrieve.\nFor example, if you retrieve an invoice PDF, the value of the `Content-Type`\nheader in the response is `application/pdf;charset=UTF-8`.\n\nOther content types include:\n\n- `text/csv` for CSV files\n- `application/msword` for Microsoft Word files\n- `application/vnd.ms-excel` and `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet`\n  for Microsoft Excel files (*.xls* and *.xlsx* respectively)\n- `application/zip` and `application/x-gzip` for ZIP and Gzip files respectively\n- `text/html` for HTML files\n- `text/plain` for text files\n\nThe response always contains character encoding information in the `Content-Type` header.\nFor example, `Content-Type: application/zip;charset=UTF-8`.\n\n**Note:** The maximum file size is 2,047 MB. If you have a data request that exceeds this limit, Zuora returns the following 403 response: `<security:max-object-size>2047MB</security:max-object-size>`.
