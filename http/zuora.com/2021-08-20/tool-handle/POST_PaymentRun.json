You can create a payment run to be executed immediately after it is created, or a scheduled payment run to be executed in future.\n\nTo filter the payments to be collected for a payment run, you can use either of the following methods but not both:\n\n  - Use the `accountId`, `batch`, `billCycleDay`, `currency`, `paymentGatewayId`, and `billingRunId` fields to define the billing documents to be collected.\n  - Use the `data` field to specify the records of accounts and billing documents to be collected, in a more flexible manner.\n\nIf no filter criteria are specified in the request body, the payment run collects payments for all accounts.\n",
