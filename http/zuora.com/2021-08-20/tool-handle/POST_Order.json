  "description": "**Note:** This operation is only available if you have the [Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AA_Overview_of_Orders#Orders) feature enabled. Orders is now generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 284 (August 2020). If you are an existing Zuora Subscribe and Amend customer and want to adopt Orders, see [What is Orders Harmonization](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Orders_Harmonization/Orders_Harmonization#What_is_Orders_Harmonization.3F) and join the [Orders Harmonization community group](https://community.zuora.com/t5/Orders-Harmonization/gp-p/Orders-Harmonization) for more information. If you want to enable Orders, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com/).\n\n**Note:** The [Order Line Items](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Line_Items/AA_Overview_of_Order_Line_Items) feature is in the **Early Adopter** phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing it as generally available. If you want to join this early adopter program, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com/).\n\nYou can use this operation to create subscriptions and make changes to subscriptions by creating orders. You can also use this operation to create order line items by creating orders.

See [Known Limitations in Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/C_Known_Limitations_in_Orders) for additional limitations.\n\nThe limit of orders allowed on a subscription is 1000.\n\nThe limit of order line items allowed in an order is 100.\n\nZuora has the following limits on the Orders synchronous API to prevent performance degradation: \n* Up to 50 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Order) or [Preview an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call.\n* Up to 50 order actions are allowed in a single [Create an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Order) or [Preview an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call.\n* Up to 50 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Order) or [Preview an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call.\n\nIf you have an Order that exceeds any limits of the above, Zuora recommends you use the following asynchronous API operations:\n* [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously)\n* [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously)\n\nZuora has the following limits on the Orders asynchronous API operations to prevent performance degradation:\n* Up to 300 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call.\n* Up to 300 order actions are allowed in a single [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call.\n* Up to 300 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call.\n\nIf you have a need for a large order that exceeds any limits of the above, you can request a limit increase for the Orders asynchronous API by submitting a request at [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com).        \n\n**Note:** When you are to suspend a subcription (via the `suspend` order action), if in the same \"Create an order\" call you are to perform other subsequent order actions on the supscription to suspend, you must first resume the subscription (via a `resume` order action). \n\n**Note:** When using this operation to create an account, create a subscription, run billing, and collect payment in a single call, if any error occurs during the call, such as a payment processing failure and a tax engine failure, then all the other steps will be rolled back. This means that the invoice will not be generated, the subscription will not be created, and the account will not be created.\n",
