For example, if one accounting period ends on January 31, the next period must start on February 1.\n* If you have the Revenue Recognition Package and have enabled the \"Monthly recognition over time\" revenue recognition model, the accounting period start date and end date must be on the first day and last day of the month, respectively. Note that the start and end dates do not necessarily have to be in the same month.",
