The POST rsa_signatures call generates and returns the required digital signature and token for a Payment Pages 2.0 form. You need to pass the generated signature to your client for it to access Payment Pages 2.0. \n    \nThis REST service should be used only when you implement Payment Pages 2.0. \n\n**Note:** To avoid potential credit card fraud attacks, you should secure your Payment Pages from being accessed by fraudulent users before you issue client-side digital signatures and tokens.
