You must have the Manage Close Process and Run Trial Balance user permissions.\n\nLimitations\n-----------\n* The accounting period cannot already be closed.\n* The accounting period cannot be in the process of running a trial balance.\n* All earlier accounting periods must be closed.\n* There must be no required action items for the accounting period. See Reconcile Transactions Before Closing an Accounting Period for more information.\n\nNotes\n-----\nWhen you close an accounting period in Zuora, a trial balance is automatically run for that period. A successful response means only that the accounting period is now closed, but does not mean that the trial balance has successfully completed.",
