  "description": "The query call sends a query expression by specifying the object to query, the fields to retrieve from that object, and any filters to determine whether a given object should be queried.\n\n\nYou can use [Zuora Object Query Language](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/K_Zuora_Object_Query_Language) (ZOQL) to construct those queries, passing them through the `queryString`.\n\n\nOnce the call is made, the API executes the query against the specified object and returns a query response object to your application. Your application can then iterate through rows in the query response to retrieve information.\n\n## Limitations \n\nThis call has the following limitations:\n\n* All ZOQL keywords must be in lower case.\n* The number of records returned is limited to 2000 records\n* The Invoice Settlement feature is not supported. This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.\n* The default WSDL version for Actions is 79. To query objects or fields according to a different WSDL version, set the `X-Zuora-WSDL-Version` header. To find out in which WSDL version a particular object or field was introduced, see [Zuora SOAP API Version History](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/G_SOAP_API/Zuora_SOAP_API_Version_History).\n",
