After you have stopped a mass action, you can get the mass action result to see details of the mass action.\n\n- If you stop a mass action when its status is Pending, no response file is generated because no records have been processed.\n\n- If you stop a mass action when its status is Processing, a response file is generated. You can check the response file to see which records have been processed and which have not. In the response file, the **Success** column has the value `Y` (successful) or `N` (failed) for processed records, and a blank value for unprocessed records.\n\nRecords that have already been processed when a mass action is stopped are not rolled back.\n",
