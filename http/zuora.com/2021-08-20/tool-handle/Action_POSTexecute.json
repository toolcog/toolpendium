The resulting invoices are called split invoices.\n\n**Note:** This feature is in **Limited Availability**. If you wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com). \n\nTo split a draft invoice into multiple split invoices:\n\n1. Use the create call to create a separate InvoiceSplitItem object for each split invoice that you want to create from the original draft invoice.\n2. Use the create call to create a single InvoiceSplit object to collect all of the InvoiceSplitItem objects.\n3. Use the execute call to split the draft invoice into multiple split invoices.\n\nYou need to create InvoiceSplitItem objects and an InvoiceSplit object before you can use the execute call. \n\n* Supported objects: InvoiceSplit\n* Asynchronous process: yes\n",
