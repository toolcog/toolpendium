As of Zuora Billing Release 284, Orders is generally available and the Order Metrics feature is no longer available as a standalone feature. If you are an existing Subscribe and Amend customer and want Order Metrics only, you must turn on [Orders Harmonization](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Orders_Harmonization/Orders_Harmonization). You can still keep the existing Subscribe and Amend API integrations to create and manage subscriptions.\n\n**Note:** The [Order Line Items](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Line_Items/AA_Overview_of_Order_Line_Items) feature is in the **Early Adopter** phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing it as generally available. If you want to join this early adopter program, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com/).\n\nRetrieves the detailed information about all orders for a specified subscription.
