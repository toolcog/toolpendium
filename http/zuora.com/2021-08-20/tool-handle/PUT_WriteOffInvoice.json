The generated credit memo items and credit memo taxation items are applied to invoice items and invoice taxation items based on the configured default application rule. If an invoice is written off, the balance of each invoice item and invoice taxation item must be zero.\n\nIf you set the **Create credit memos mirroring invoice items billing rule** to **Yes**, you can write off an invoice even if all its items have zero balance.\n\n**Restrictions**\n\nYou cannot write off an invoice if any of the following restrictions is met:\n\n* The balance of an invoice has been changed before Invoice Settlement is enabled.\n\n  For example, before Invoice Settlement is enabled, any credit balance adjustments, invoice item adjustments, or invoice adjustments have been applied to an invoice.\n\n* An invoice contains more than 2,000 items in total, including invoice items, discount items, and taxation items.\n\nSee [Invoice Write-off](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/IA_Invoices/Invoice_Write-Off) for more information.        \n",
