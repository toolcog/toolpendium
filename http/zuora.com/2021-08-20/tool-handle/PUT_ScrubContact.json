Otherwise, it might cause errors in subsequent operations.\n\n**Note**: To use this operation, you must ensure that the \"Scrub Sensitive Data of Contact\" billing permission is enabled in your user role. Contact your tenant administrator if you want to enable this permission. See [Scrub Contacts](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Customer_Accounts/A_How_to_Manage_Customer_Accounts/B_Key_Contacts/Scrub_Contacts) for more information.\n",
