  "description": "**Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information. \n\nCreates a payment in the following scenarios:\n\n- A full or partial payment on an invoice or a debit memo\n- A full or partial payment on several invoices and debit memos\n- An unapplied payment in the following situations:\n  - You do not know which customer account the payment belongs to.\n  - You know which customer account the payment belongs to, but you do not know which invoice the payment is applied to.\n  - You receive a payment from your customer that exceeds the balance on the invoice.\n  - You receive a payment from your customer before the invoice has been created.\n  - You intend to create a payment without any invoices or debit memos.\n- A standalone payment. If you only need to create and process an electronic payment in Zuora through a Zuora gateway integration but settle the payment outside of Zuora, you can create a standalone payment. For a standalone payment, you can specify a currency different from the payment currency in the customer account settings. \n\n  The support for standalone payments is in the Early Adopter phase. If you want to use this feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/) to enable it.\n\nIf you do not know to which customer account the payment belongs, you can create a payment without specifying a customer account.\n\nWhen you create a payment, the total number of invoice items and debit memo items that the payment will apply to should be less than or equal to 10,000.\n\nFor more information, see [Create Payments](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Invoice_Settlement/A_Unapplied_Payments/Management_of_Unapplied_Payments/AA_Create_Payments) and [Create Payments Without Specifying Customer Accounts](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Invoice_Settlement/A_Unapplied_Payments/Management_of_Unapplied_Payments/AA_Create_Payments_Without_Specifying_Customer_Accounts).\n    \n",
