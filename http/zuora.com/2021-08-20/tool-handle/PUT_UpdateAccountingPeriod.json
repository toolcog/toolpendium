See [Finance Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/f_Finance_Roles).\n\nLimitations\n-----------\n\n* You can update the start date of only the earliest accounting period on your tenant. You cannot update the start date of later periods.\n\n* If you update the earliest accounting period, the start date must be equal to or earlier than the date of the earliest transaction on the tenant.\n\n* Start and end dates of accounting periods must be contiguous. For example, if one accounting period ends on January 31, the next period must start on February 1.\n\n* If you have the Revenue Recognition Package and have enabled the \"Monthly recognition over time\" revenue recognition model, the accounting period start date and end date must be on the first day and last day of the month, respectively. Note that the start and end dates do not necessarily have to be in the same month.\n\n* You cannot update the start date or end date of an accounting period if:\n  * Any revenue has been distributed into the period.\n  * The period has any active journal entries.\n",
