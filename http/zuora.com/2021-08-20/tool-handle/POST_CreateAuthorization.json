Subsequently, use [CRUD: Create a payment](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Object_POSTPayment) or [Create a payment](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreatePayment) to capture the authorized funds, or use [Cancel authorization](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CancelAuthorization) to cancel the authorization. \n\nThe payment gateways that support this operation include:\n\n* Adyen integration v2.0 - This gateway does not support [Cancel authorization](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CancelAuthorization).\n* CyberSource 1.28\n* CyberSource 1.97\n* CyberSource 2.0 - This gateway does not support [Cancel authorization](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CancelAuthorization).\n* Chase Paymentech Orbital\n* Ingenico ePayments\n* Verifi - This gateway does not support [Cancel authorization](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CancelAuthorization).\n\nNote that CyberSource 2.0 supports the Delayed Capture feature for both Credit Cards and Credit Card Reference payment methods.\n\nIf you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, use the [Create payment](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreatePayment) operation to capture the funds instead of the [CRUD: Create payment](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Object_POSTPayment) operation.\n      \n",
