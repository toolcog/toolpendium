The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information. \n\nUnapplies an applied payment from invoices and debit memos.\n\nWhen you unapply a payment, the total number of invoice items and debit memo items that the payment will unapply from must be less than or equal to 10,000.\n\nIf the limit is hit, you can follow the instructions:\n- If you want to unapply one payment without specifying invoices or debit memos, you have to specify the invoices or debit memos in the request.\n- If you want to unapply one payment from multiple specified invoices or debit memos, decrease the number of invoices or debit memos in the request.\n- If you want to unapply one payment from a single invoice or debit memo with a large volume of items, you have to specify invoice items in the request. The maximum number of invoice items that you can specify in the request is 1,000.\n\nFor more information, see [Unapply Payments from Invoices and Debit Memos](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Invoice_Settlement/A_Unapplied_Payments/Management_of_Unapplied_Payments/Unapply_Payments_from_Invoices_and_Debit_Memos).\n",
