  "description": "Use the create call to create one or more objects of a specific type. You can specify different types in different create calls, but each create call must apply to only one type of object.\n\n## Limitations \n\nThis call has the following limitations:\n\n* A maximum of 50 objects are supported in a single call.\n* The Invoice Settlement feature is not supported. This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.\n* The default WSDL version for Actions is 79. To create objects according to a different WSDL version, set the `X-Zuora-WSDL-Version` header. To find out in which WSDL version a particular object or field was introduced, see [Zuora SOAP API Version History](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/G_SOAP_API/Zuora_SOAP_API_Version_History).\n\n\n## How to Use this Call\n\nYou can call create on an array of one or more zObjects. It returns an array of SaveResults, indicating the success or failure of creating each object. The following information applies to this call:\n\n* You cannot pass in null zObjects.\n* You can pass in a maximum of 50 zObjects at a time.\n* All objects must be of the same type.\n\nFor a use case of this call, see [Upload usage records](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-guides/#Upload-usage-records).\n\n### Using Create and Subscribe Calls \nBoth the create and subscribe calls will create a new account. However, there are differences between the calls.\n\nUse the create call to create an account independent of a subscription.\n\nUse the subscribe call to create the account with the subscription and the initial payment information.\n",
