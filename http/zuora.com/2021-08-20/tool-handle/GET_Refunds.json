Each query parameter corresponds to one field in the response body.\n\nIf the value of a filterable field is string, you can set the corresponding query parameter to `null` when filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being `null`.\n\nExamples:\n\n- /v1/refunds?status=Processed\n\n- /v1/refunds?amount=4&status=Processed\n\n- /v1/refunds?status=Processed&type=External&sort=+number\n",
