See [Finance Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/f_Finance_Roles).\n\n          \nLimitations \n-----------\n \n * The accounting period must be open.\n \n * The accounting period cannot already be in the process of running a trial balance.\n \nNotes\n-----\nThe trial balance is run asynchronously. A response of `{ \"success\": true }` means only that the trial balance has started processing, but does not mean that the trial balance has successfully completed. You can use the [Get Accounting Period](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/GET_AccountingPeriod) REST API call to view details about the outcome of the trial balance.\n",
