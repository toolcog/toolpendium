  "description": "\nUpdates the information in one or more objects of the same type. You can specify different types of objects in different update calls, but each specific update call must apply to only one type of object.\n\nYou can update an array of one or more zObjects. It returns an array of SaveResults, indicating the success or failure of updating each object. The following information applies to this call:\n\n* You cannot pass in null zObjects.\n* You can pass in a maximum of 50 zObjects at a time.\n* All objects must be of the same type.\n* For each field in each object, you must determine that object's ID. Then populate the fields that you want update with the new information.\n* Zuora ignores unrecognized fields in update calls. For example, if an optional field is spelled incorrectly or a field that does not exist is specified, Zuora ignores the field and continues to process the call. No error message is returned for unrecognized fields.\n\n## Limitations \n\nThis call has the following limitations:\n\n* A maximum of 50 objects are supported in a single call.\n* The Invoice Settlement feature is not supported. This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.\n* The default WSDL version for Actions is 79. To update objects or fields according to a different WSDL version, set the `X-Zuora-WSDL-Version` header. To find out in which WSDL version a particular object or field was introduced, see [Zuora SOAP API Version History](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/G_SOAP_API/Zuora_SOAP_API_Version_History).\n",
