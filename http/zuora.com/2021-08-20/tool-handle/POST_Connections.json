  "description": "Establishes a connection to the Zuora REST API service based on a valid user credentials. \n\n**Note:**This is a legacy REST API. Zuora recommends you to use [OAuth](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#section/Authentication/OAuth-v2.0) for authentication instead. \n\nThis call authenticates the user and returns an API session cookie that's used to authorize subsequent calls to the REST API. The credentials must belong to a user account that has permission to access the API service.\n\nAs noted elsewhere, it's strongly recommended that an account used for Zuora API activity is never used to log into the Zuora UI.  Once an account is used to log into the UI, it may be subject to periodic forced password changes, which may eventually lead to authentication failures when using the API.\n",
