  "description": "Adds a contributor to a node, effectively creating a relationship between the node and a user.\n\nContributors are users who can make changes to the node or, in the case of private nodes, have read access to the node.\n\nContributors are categorized as either \"bibliographic\" or \"non-bibliographic\" contributors. From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed on the project overview page on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.\n#### Permissions\nOnly project administrators can add contributors to a node.\n#### Required\nA relationship object with a `data` key, containing the `users` type and valid user ID is required.\n\nAll attributes describing the relationship between the node and the user are optional.\n#### Returns\nReturns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the new contributor, if the request is successful.\n\nIf the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.",
