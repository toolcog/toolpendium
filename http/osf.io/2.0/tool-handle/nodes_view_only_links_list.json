  "description": "List of view only links on a node.\n#### Returns\nReturns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.\n\nThe `data` key contains an array of up to 10 view only links. Each resource in the array is a view only link object.\n\nThe `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).\n\n#### Permissions\n\nView only links on a node, public or private, are readable and writeable only by users that are administrators on the node.\n\n#### Filtering\n\nYou can optionally request that the response only include view only links that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/view_only_links/?filter[anonymous]=true.\n\nView Only Links may be filtered based on their `name`, `anonymous` and `date_created` fields. Possible comparison operators include 'gt' (greater than), 'gte'(greater than or equal to), 'lt' (less than) and 'lte' (less than or equal to). The date must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD and the time is optional.",
