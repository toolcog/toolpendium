  "description": "This creates a Draft Registration that can be used to edit and register research.\nDraft Registrations contain Registration questions that will become part of the Registration. A Registration is a frozen version of the project that can never be deleted, but can be withdrawn and have it's metadata edited.\nA Draft Registration created by this endpoint will not have a Project linked with it by default, but if the user includes a `branched_from` attribute in their Draft Registration creation payload with the value of the `branched_from` being guid of a Project they have permissions for the Draft Registration will be linked to the Project. If you linked your Draft Registration on a Project, your original Project remains editable and will now have the Draft Registration linked to it. \n#### Permissions\nAny user can create a Draft Registration. If the `branched_from` attribute is provided, then the user must be an ADMIN contributor on the Project being registered.\n#### Required\nRequired fields for creating a Draft Registration include:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`schema_id`\n#### Returns\nReturns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the created Draft Registration, if the request is successful.\n\nIf the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.",
