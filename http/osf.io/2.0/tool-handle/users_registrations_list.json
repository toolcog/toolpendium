  "description": "A paginated list of registrations that the user is a contributor to. The returned registrations are sorted by their `date_modified`, with the most recently updated registrations appearing first.\n\nIf the user ID in the path is the same as the logged-in user, all registrations will be returned. Otherwise, only the user's public registrations will be returned.\n\nUser nodes are not available at this endpoint.\n#### Returns\nReturns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.\n\nThe `data` key contains an array of 10 registrations. Each resource in the array is a separate registration object and contains the full representation of the registration, meaning additional requests to a registration's detail view are not necessary.\n\nThe `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).\n#### Filtering\nYou can optionally request that the response only include registrations that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/users/cdi38/registrations/?filter[title]=replication.\n\nRegistrations may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`.",
