  "description": "Creates a fork of the given registration.\n\nForking a project creates a copy of an existing registration and all of its contents. The fork always points back to the original registration, forming a network of registrations.\n\nYou might use a fork to copy another's work to build on and extend. For example, a professor may create an OSF project of materials for individual student use. Each student forks the project to have his or her own copy of the materials to start his/her own work.\n\nWhen creating a fork, your fork will only contain public components of the current registration and components for which you are a contributor. Private components that you do not have access to will not be forked.\n#### Required\nThere are no required attributes when creating a fork, as all of the forked registration's attributes will be copied from the current registration.\n\nThe `title` field is optional, with the default title being \"Fork of \" prepended to the current registration's title.\n#### Returns\nReturns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the complete representation of the forked registration, if the request is successful.\nIf the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.",
