  "description": "This method is required to verify payouts by using your 2fa code.  \nYou’ll have 10 attempts to verify the payout. If it is not verified after 10 attempts, the payout will remain in ‘creating’ status.  \nPayout will be processed only when it is verified.\n\nMake sure to have your 2fa authentication enabled in your NOWPayments Account (in Account Settings).  \nWhen 2fa is disabled, the code automatically goes to your registration email.  \nThe code sent by email is valid for one hour.\n\nNext is a description of the required request fields:\n\n- :batch-withdrawal-id - payout id you received in `2. Create payout` method\n- verification_code - 2fa code you received with your Google Auth app or via email\n    \n\nIn order to establish an automatic verification of payouts, you should switch 2FA through the application.  \nThere are several libraries for different frameworks aimed on generating a 2FA codes based on a secret key from your account settings.  \ne.g: Speakeasy for JavaScript.  \nWe do not recommend to change any default settings.  \n\n```\nconst 2faVerificationCode = speakeasy.totp({\n      your_2fa_secret_key,\n      encoding: 'base32',\n})\n```",
