Only one payout state can be specified with this filter. The supported <b>payoutStatus</b> values are as follows:<ul><li><code>INITIATED</code>: search for payouts that have been initiated but not processed.</li><li><code>SUCCEEDED</code>: search for successful payouts.</li><li><code>RETRYABLE_FAILED</code>: search for payouts that failed, but ones which will be tried again. This value must be used if filtering by <b>lastAttemptedPayoutDate</b>. </li><li><code>TERMINAL_FAILED</code>: search for payouts that failed, and ones that will not be tried again.</li><li> <code>REVERSED</code>: search for payouts that were reversed. </li></ul>Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by payout status: <br><br><code>https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/payout?filter=payoutStatus:{SUCCEEDED}</code></ul><br>If both the <b>payoutDate</b> and <b>payoutStatus</b> filters are used, payouts must satisfy both criteria to be returned.
