  "description": "**Supported File Types**\nWe support PDF, docx and doc. Contact us to add support for any other file type. If you're using docx or doc files, you'll need to convert the file first using our uploads endpoint with the querystring parameter ?convert=post. e.g. POST /uploads?convert=post. This will return a URL to the converted pdf file that can be used in the /post/postcards/send endpoint.\n\n**Postcard File Options**\n\n**Use existing URL**\n\nWith this option, you can use an existing URL to a PDF document. For example, you might generate the pdf on your server.\n\nFor `file_urls` field. You can attach at least 1 and max of 2 PDF file urls.\n\n- Supply a single pdf with 2 pages (front and back)\n\n- Supply 2 urls to seperate PDFs\n\n**Upload File to Our Server**\n\nWith this option, you can use the `/uploads` endpoint to upload the document. The `/uploads` endpoint returns a URL that can be used in the `/post/postcards/send` endpoint.",
