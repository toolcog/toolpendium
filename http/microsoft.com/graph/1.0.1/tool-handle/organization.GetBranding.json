If no default organizational branding object exists, this method returns a `404 Not Found` error. If the **Accept-Language** header is set to an existing locale identified by the value of its **id**, this method retrieves the branding for the specified locale. This method retrieves only non-Stream properties, for example, **usernameHintText** and **signInPageText**. To retrieve Stream types of the default branding, for example, **bannerLogo** and **backgroundImage**, use the GET organizationalBrandingLocalization method.",
