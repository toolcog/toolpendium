            "**changeType**: Required. Indicates the type of change in the subscribed resource that will raise a change notification. The supported values are: created, updated, deleted. Multiple values can be combined using a comma-separated list. Note:  Drive root item and list change notifications support only the updated changeType. User and group change notifications support updated and deleted changeType. Use updated to receive notifications when user or group is created, updated or soft deleted.  Use deleted to receive notifications when user or group is permanently deleted.",
            "**clientState**: Optional. Specifies the value of the clientState property sent by the service in each change notification. The maximum length is 128 characters. The client can check that the change notification came from the service by comparing the value of the clientState property sent with the subscription with the value of the clientState property received with each change notification.",

The time is in UTC, and can be an amount of time from subscription creation that varies for the resource subscribed to. For the maximum supported subscription length of time, see the table below.",

The possible values are: v1_0, v1_1, v1_2, v1_3. For subscribers whose notification endpoint supports a version lower than the currently recommended version (TLS 1.2), specifying this property by a set timeline allows them to temporarily use their deprecated version of TLS before completing their upgrade to TLS 1.2. For these subscribers, not setting this property per the timeline would result in subscription operations failing. For subscribers whose notification endpoint already supports TLS 1.2, setting this property is optional. In such cases, Microsoft Graph defaults the property to v1_2.",

            "**notificationQueryOptions**: Optional. OData query options for specifying value for the targeting resource. Clients receive notifications when resource reaches the state matching the query options provided here. With this new property in the subscription creation payload along with all existing properties, Webhooks will deliver notifications whenever a resource reaches the desired state mentioned in the notificationQueryOptions property. For example, when the print job is completed or when a print job resource isFetchable property value becomes true etc.  Supported only for Universal Print Service. For more information, see Subscribe to change notifications from cloud printing APIs using Microsoft Graph.",

            "**notificationUrlAppId**: Optional. The app ID that the subscription service can use to generate the validation token. This allows the client to validate the authenticity of the notification received.",
            "**resource**: Required. Specifies the resource that will be monitored for changes. Do not include the base URL (https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/). See the possible resource path values for each supported resource."
