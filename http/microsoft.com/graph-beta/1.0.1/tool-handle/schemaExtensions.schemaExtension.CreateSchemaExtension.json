  "description": "Create a new schemaExtension definition and its associated schema extension property to extend a supporting resource type. Schema extensions let you add strongly-typed custom data to a resource. The app that creates a schema extension is the owner app. Depending on the \nstate of the extension, the owner app, and only the owner app, may update or delete the extension.  See examples of how to define a schema extension that describes a training course, \nuse the schema extension definition to create a new group with training course data, and \nadd training course data to an existing group.",

The owner of the schema definition must be explicitly specified during the Create and Update operations, or it will be implied and auto-assigned by Azure AD as follows: In delegated access: The signed-in user must be the owner of the app that calls Microsoft Graph to create the schema extension definition.  If the signed-in user isn't the owner of the calling app, they must explicitly specify the owner property, and assign it the appId of an app that they own. In app-only access:  The owner property isn't required in the request body. Instead, the calling app is assigned ownership of the schema extension. So, for example, if creating a new schema extension definition using Graph Explorer, you must supply the owner property. Once set, this property is read-only and cannot be changed.
