Then devices can connect to it as if Home is just another bluetooth speaker.\n>\n> *Part 2*: Bluetooth speakers connect to Home and Home plays audio through the speakers.\n> For this, /setup/bluetooth/scan and /setup/bluetooth/scan_results are used to connect to other speakers.\n>\n> The other endpoints are common for both parts.\n\n\n**For both parts**\n\nThis gives the status of all bluetooth things.\n- Not sure what `audio_mode` is.\n- `discovery_enabled` states whether Home is discoverable. (**Part 1**)\n- `connecting_devices` is a list of all media sources (like phones) connected to Home. (**Part 1**)\n- `scanning_enabled` states whether Home scanning for other bluetooth speakers/devices. (**Part 2**)\n- `connected_devices` is a list of all speakers connected to Home. (**Part 2**)",
