  "description": "This endpoint allows you to merge a forked collection back to its destination collection.\n\nOn successful creation of the collection, the response returns the collection `name`, `id` and `uid`.\n\nYou need to specify the fork UID (as `source`) and destination collection UID (as `destination`) in the request body.\n\nOptionally, you can also specify the merge strategy as either `deleteSource` or `updateSourceWithDestination`. Following is an explanation of the merge strategies\n\n| Merge Strategy | Behaviour |\n| --- | --- |\n| deleteSource | Forked collection is deleted after merging |\n| updateSourceWithDestination | Forked collection is up to date with changes in destination collection |\n\nIf the collections cannot be merged (due to conflicts), appropriate error messages will be returned.\n\n\n> Requires <a href=\"#authentication\">API Key</a> as `X-Api-Key` request header or `apikey` URL query parameter.",
