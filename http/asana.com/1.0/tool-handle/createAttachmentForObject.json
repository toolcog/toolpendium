Note that it is not possible to attach\nfiles from third party services such as Dropbox, Box, Vimeo & Google Drive via the API\n\nThe 100MB size limit on attachments in Asana is enforced on this endpoint.\n\nThis endpoint expects a multipart/form-data encoded request containing the full contents of the file to be uploaded.\n\nRequests made should follow the HTTP/1.1 specification that line\nterminators are of the form `CRLF` or `\\r\\n` outlined\n[here](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-01#Basic-Rules) in order for the server to reliably and properly handle the request.",
